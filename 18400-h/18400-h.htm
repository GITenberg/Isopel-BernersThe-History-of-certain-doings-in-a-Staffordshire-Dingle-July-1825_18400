<h3>I.</h3>
<p>The last century was yet in its infancy when the author of <i>The
Romany Rye</i> first saw the light in the sleepy little East Anglian
township of East Dereham, in the county distinguished by Borrow as the
one in which the people eat the best dumplings in the world and speak
the purest English.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty quiet D[ereham]&rdquo; was the
retreat in those days of a Lady Bountiful in the person of Dame Eleanor
Fenn, relict of the worthy editor of the <i>Paston Letters</i>.&nbsp;
It is better known in literary history as the last resting-place of
a sad and unquiet spirit, escaped from a world in which it had known
nought but sorrow, of &ldquo;England&rsquo;s sweetest and most pious
bard,&rdquo; William Cowper.&nbsp; But Destiny was weaving a robuster
thread to connect East Dereham with literature, for George Borrow <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
was born there on July 5th, 1803, and, nomad though he was, the place
was always dear to his heart as his earliest home.</p>
<p>In 1816, after ramblings far and wide both in Ireland and in Scotland,
the Borrows settled in Norwich, where George was schooled under a master
whose name at <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>least
is still familiar to English youth, Dr. Valpy (brother of Dr. Richard
Valpy).&nbsp; Among his schoolfellows at the grammar school were Rajah
Brooke and Dr. James Martineau.&nbsp; George Borrow, a hardened truant
from his earliest teens, was once horsed, to undergo a flogging, on
the back of James Martineau, and he never afterwards took kindly to
the philosophy of that remarkable man.&nbsp; We are glad to know that
Edward Valpy&rsquo;s ferule was weak, though his scholarship was strong.&nbsp;
Stories were current that even in those days George used to haunt the
gipsy tents on that Mousehold Heath which lives eternally in the breezy
canvases of &ldquo;Old Crome,&rdquo; and that he went so far as to stain
his face with walnut-juice to the right Egyptian hue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you suffering from jaundice, Borrow,&rdquo; asked the Doctor, &ldquo;or
is it merely dirt?&rdquo;&nbsp; While at Norwich, too, he was greatly
influenced in the direction of linguistics by the English &ldquo;pocket
Goethe,&rdquo; William Taylor, the head of a clan known as the Taylors
of Norwich, to distinguish them from a race in which the principle of
heredity was even more strikingly developed&mdash;the Taylors of Ongar.&nbsp;
In February 1824 his father, the gallant Captain Thomas Borrow, died,
and his articles in the firm of a Norwich solicitor having determined,
George went to London to commence literary man, in the old sense of
the servitude, under the well-known bookseller-publisher, Sir Richard
Phillipps.&nbsp; In Grub Street he translated and compiled galore, but
when the trees began to shoot in 1825 he broke his chain and escaped
to the country, to the dingle, and to Isopel Berners.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>To
dwell upon the bare outlines of Borrow&rsquo;s early career would be
a superfluously dull proceeding.&nbsp; We shall only add a few names
and dates to the framework, supplied with a fidelity that is rare in
much more formal works of autobiography, in the pages of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp;
From the same pages we may detach just a few of the earlier influences
which went to make up the rare and complex individuality of the writer.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s father, a fine old soldier, in revealing his son&rsquo;s
youthful idiosyncrasy, projects a clear mental image of his own habit
of mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boy had the impertinence to say the classics
were much over-valued, and amongst other things that some horrid fellow
or other, some Welshman, I think (thank God it was not an Irishman),
was a better poet than Ovid. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp;
That a boy of his years should entertain an opinion of his own, I mean
one which militates against all established authority, is astonishing.&nbsp;
As well might a raw recruit pretend to offer an unfavourable opinion
on the manual and platoon exercise.&nbsp; The idea is preposterous;
the lad is too independent by half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s account of his father&rsquo;s death is a highly affecting
piece of English.&nbsp; The ironical humour blent with pathos in his
picture of this ill-rewarded old disciplinarian (who combined a tenderness
of heart with a fondness for military metaphor that frequently reminds
one of &ldquo;My Uncle Toby&rdquo;), the details of the ailments and
the portents that attended his infantile career, and, <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>above
all, the glimpses of the wandering military life from barrack to barrack
and from garrison to garrison, inevitably remind the reader of the childish
reminiscences of Laurence Sterne, a writer to whom it may thus early
be said that George Borrow paid no small amount of unconscious homage.&nbsp;
A homage of another sort, fully recognised and declared, was that paid
to the great work of Defoe, and to the spirit of strange and romantic
enterprise which it aroused in its reader.</p>
<p>After <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> there played across the disk of his
youthful memory a number of weird and hairy figures never to be effaced.&nbsp;
A strange old herbalist and snake-killer with a skin cap first whetted
his appetite for the captivating confidences of roadside vagrants, and
the acquaintanceship serves as an introduction to the scene of the gipsy
encampment, where the young Sapengro or serpent charmer was first claimed
as brother by Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp; The picture of the encampment
may serve as an example of Borrovian prose, nervous, unembarrassed,
and graphic.</p>
<blockquote><p>One day it happened, being on my rambles, I entered a
green lane which I had never seen before.&nbsp; At first it was rather
narrow, but as I advanced it became considerably wider.&nbsp; In the
middle was a drift-way with deep ruts, but right and left was a space
carpeted with a sward of trefoil and clover.&nbsp; There was no lack
of trees, chiefly ancient oaks, which, flinging out their arms from
either side, nearly formed a canopy and afforded a pleasing shelter
from the rays of the sun, which was burning fiercely above.&nbsp; Suddenly
a group of objects attracted my attention.&nbsp; Beneath one of the
largest of the trees, upon the grass, was a kind of low <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>tent
or booth, from the top of which a thin smoke was curling.&nbsp; Beside
it stood a couple of light carts, whilst two or three lean horses or
ponies were cropping the herbage which was growing nigh. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a pendant to the landscape take a Flemish interior.&nbsp; The
home of the Borrows had been removed in the meantime, in accordance
with the roving traditions of the family, from Norman Cross to Edinburgh
and from Edinburgh to Clonmel.</p>
<blockquote><p>And to the school I went [at Clonmel], where I read the
Latin tongue and the Greek letters with a nice old clergyman who sat
behind a black oaken desk with a huge Elzevir Flaccus before him, in
a long gloomy kind of hall with a broken stone floor, the roof festooned
with cobwebs, the walls considerably dilapidated and covered over with
stray figures in hieroglyphics evidently produced by the application
of a burnt stick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ireland, too, he made the acquaintance of the gossoon Murtagh,
who taught him Irish in return for a pack of cards.&nbsp; In the course
of his wanderings with his father&rsquo;s regiment he develops into
a well-grown and well-favoured lad, a shrewd walker and a bold rider.&nbsp;
&ldquo;People may talk of first love&mdash;it is a very agreeable event,
I dare say&mdash;but give me the flush, the triumph, and glorious sweat
of a first ride.&rdquo; <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a></p>
<p>At Norwich he learns modern languages from an old <i>emigr&eacute;</i>,
a true disciple of the <i>ancien cour</i>, who sets Boileau high above
Dante; and some misty German <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>metaphysics
from the Norwich philosopher, who consistently seeks a solace in smoke
from the troubles of life.&nbsp; His father had already noted his tendency
to fly off at a tangent which was strikingly exhibited in the lawyer&rsquo;s
office, where &ldquo;within the womb of a lofty deal desk,&rdquo; when
he should have been imbibing Blackstone and transcribing legal documents,
he was studying Monsieur Vidocq and translating the Welsh bard Ab Gwilym;
he was consigning his legal career to an early grave when he wrote this
elegy on the worthy attorney his master.</p>
<blockquote><p>He has long since sunk to his place in a respectable
vault, in the aisle of a very respectable church, whilst an exceedingly
respectable marble slab against the neighbouring wall tells on a Sunday
some eye wandering from its prayer-book that his dust lies below.&nbsp;
To secure such respectabilities in death he passed a most respectable
life, a more respectable-looking individual never was seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meantime as a sequel to his questionings on the subjects of
reality and truth, the Author was asking himself &ldquo;What is death?&rdquo;
and the query serves as a prelude to the first of the many breezy dialogues
with that gipsy cousin-german to Autolycus, Jasper Petulengro.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What is your opinion of death, Mr. Petulengro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My opinion of death, brother, is much the same as that in
the old song of Pharaoh . . . when a man dies he is cast into the earth
and his wife and child sorrow over him.&nbsp; If he has neither wife
nor child, then his father and mother, I suppose; and if he is quite
alone in the world, <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>why,
then he is cast into the earth and there is an end of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think that is the end of man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an end of him, brother, more&rsquo;s the pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is sweet, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so! there&rsquo;s night and day, brother, both sweet
things; sun, moon and stars, brother, all sweet things; there&rsquo;s
likewise a wind on the heath.&nbsp; Life is very sweet, brother: who
would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would wish to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a gorgio&mdash;which is the same as talking
like a fool; were you a Romany chal you would talk wiser.&nbsp; Wish
to die, indeed! a Romany chal would wish to live for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sickness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sun and stars, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In blindness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the wind on the heath, brother; if I could only
feel that I would gladly live for ever.&nbsp; D&aelig;ta, we&rsquo;ll
now go to the tents and put on the gloves, and I&rsquo;ll try to make
you feel what a sweet thing it is to be alive, brother.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving Norwich and his legal trammels, a few weeks after his father&rsquo;s
death, in 1824, Lavengro reaches London&mdash;the scene of Grub Street
struggles not greatly relaxed in severity since the days of Newbery,
Gardener and Christopher Smart.&nbsp; As the genius of Hawthorne was
cooped up and enslaved for the American &ldquo;Peter Parley,&rdquo;
so that of Borrow was hag-ridden by a bookseller publisher of an even
worse type, the radical alderman and philanthropic sweater, Sir Richard
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Phillipps.&nbsp;
For this stony-hearted faddist he covered reams of paper with printers&rsquo;
copy; and we are told that the kind of compilation that he liked (and
probably executed) best was that of <i>Newgate Lives and Trials</i>.&nbsp;
He had well-nigh reached the end of his tether when he had the conversation
with Phillipps&rsquo;s head factotum, Taggart, which we cite below and
recommend feelingly to the consideration of every literary aspirant.&nbsp;
Sordid and commonplace enough are the details; simple and free from
every kind of inflation the language in which they are narrated.&nbsp;
Yet how picturesque are these vignettes of London life!&nbsp; How vivid
and yet how strange are the figures that animate them!&nbsp; The harsh
literary impresario with his &ldquo;drug in the market,&rdquo; who seems
to have stalked straight out of Smollett, <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a>
the gnarled old applewoman, with every wrinkle shown, on her stall upon
London Bridge, the grasping Armenian merchant who softened at the sound
of his native tongue, the giddy young spendthrift Francis Ardry and
the confiding young creature who had permitted him to hire her a very
handsome floor in the West End, the gipsies and thimble-riggers in Greenwich
Park&mdash;what moving and lifelike figures are these, stippled in with
a seeming absence of art, yet as strange and as rare as a Night in Bagdad,
a chapter of Balzac, or the most fantastic scene in the <i>New Arabian
Nights</i>.</p>
<p>This brief recapitulation&mdash;in which it has been <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>possible
but just to touch upon a few of the inner springs of Borrow&rsquo;s
life as revealed in the autobiographical <i>Lavengro</i>&mdash;brings
us once again to that spring day in 1825&mdash;May 20th&mdash;when the
author disposed of an unidentifiable manuscript for the sumptuous equivalent
of &pound;20.&nbsp; On May 22nd, after little more than a year&rsquo;s
residence in London, he abandons the city.&nbsp; From London he proceeds
to Amesbury, in Wiltshire, which he reaches on May 23rd; visits Stonehenge,
the Roman Camp of Old Sarum and Salisbury; on May 26th he leaves Salisbury,
and (after an encounter with the long-lost son of the old applewoman,
returned from Botany Bay), strikes north-west.&nbsp; On the 30th he
has been walking four days in a northerly direction, when he arrives
at the inn where the maid Jenny refreshes him at the pump, and he meets
the author with whom he passes the night.&nbsp; On the 31st he purchases
the horse and cart of Jack Slingsby, whom he had previously seen but
once, at Tamworth, many years ago when he was little more than a child.&nbsp;
On June 1st he makes the first practical experience of a vagrant&rsquo;s
life, and passes the night in the open air in a Shropshire dell; on
June 5th he is visited by Leonora Herne, the grandchild of the old &ldquo;brimstone
hag&rdquo; who was jealous of the cordiality with which the young stranger
had been received by the Petulengroes and initiated in the secrets of
their gipsy tribe.&nbsp; Three days later, betrayed to the old woman
by Leonora, he is drabbed (<i>i.e.</i> poisoned) with the manricli or
doctored cake of Mrs. Herne; his life is in imminent danger, but he
is <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>saved
by the opportune arrival of Peter Williams.&nbsp; He passes Sunday,
June 12th, with the Welsh preacher and his wife Winifred; on the 21st
he departs with his itinerant hosts to the Welsh border.&nbsp; Before
entering Wales, however, he turns back with Ambrose (&ldquo;Jasper&rdquo;)
Petulengro and settles with his own stock-in-trade as tinker and blacksmith
at the foot of the dingle hard by Mumper&rsquo;s Lane, near Willenhall,
in Staffordshire; here at the end of June 1825 takes place the classical
encounter between the philologer and the flaming tinman&mdash;all this,
is it not related in <i>Lavengro</i>, and substantiated with much hard
labour of facts and dates by Dr. W. I. Knapp in his exhaustive biography
of George Borrow?&nbsp; The allurement of his genius is such that the
etymologist shall leave his roots and the philologer his Maeso-Gothic
to take to the highway and dwell in the dingle with &ldquo;Don Jorge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lavengro&rsquo;s triumph over the flaming tinman is the prelude to
what Professor Saintsbury justly calls &ldquo;the miraculous episode
of Ysopel Berners,&rdquo; and the narrative of the author&rsquo;s life
is thence continued, with many digressions, but with a remarkable fidelity
to fact as far as the main issue is concerned, until the narrative,
though not the life-story of the author, abruptly terminates at Horncastle,
in August 1825.&nbsp; There follows what is spoken of as the veiled
period of Borrow&rsquo;s life, from 1826 to 1833.</p>
<p>The years in which we drift are generally veiled from posterity.&nbsp;
The system of psychometry carried to such perfection by Obermann and
Amiel could at no time <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>have
been exactly congenial to Borrow, who spoke of himself at this period
as &ldquo;digging holes in the sand and filling them up again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Roughly speaking, the years appear to have been spent comparatively
uneventfully, for the most part in Norfolk.&nbsp; In December 1832 he
walked to London to interview the British and Foreign Bible Society,
covering a hundred and twelve miles in twenty-seven hours on less than
sixpennyworth of food and drink.&nbsp; He was thirty years old at the
time, and the achievement was the pride of his remaining years.&nbsp;
Six months later, on the strength of his linguistic attainments, he
managed to get on the paid staff of the Society, to the bewilderment
of Norwich &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; who were inclined to be ironical on
the subject of the transformation of the chum of hanged Thurtell and
the disciple of godless Billy Taylor into a Bible missionary.&nbsp;
In July 1833, then, Borrow sets out on his Eastern travels as the accredited
agent of the Bible Society, goes to St. Petersburg, &ldquo;the finest
city in the world,&rdquo; and obtains the Russian imprimatur for a Manchu
version of that suspicious novelty, the Bible.&nbsp; He carried this
scheme into execution to the general satisfaction, and he returns to
London in 1837; then to the south of Europe, whence he reappears, larger
than life and twice as natural, in his masterly autobiographical romance
of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, the work which made his name, which was
sold by thousands, which was eagerly acclaimed as an invaluable addition
to &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo; literature, and pirated in a generous spirit
of emulation by American publishers.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>We
are now come to the circumstance of the composition of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The Bible in Spain</i>, when it appeared in 1843, implied a wonderful
background to the Author&rsquo;s experience, a career diversified by
all kinds of wild adventures, &ldquo;sorcery, Jews, Gentiles, rambles,&rdquo;
gipsies, prisons,&mdash;what you will. <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12">{12}</a></p>
<p>The personal element in the book&mdash;so suggestive of mystery and
romance&mdash;excited the strongest curiosity.&nbsp; Apart from this,
however, the reading public of 1843 were not unnaturally startled by
a book which seemed to profess to be a good, serious, missionary work,
but for which it was manifest that <i>Gil Blas</i> and not Bishop Heber
had been taken as a model.&nbsp; Not that any single comparison of the
kind can convey the least idea of the complex idiosyncrasy of such a
work.&nbsp; There is a substratum of <i>Guide Book</i> and <i>Gil Blas</i>,
no doubt, but there are unmistakable streaks of Defoe, of Dumas, and
of Dickens, with all his native prejudices and insular predilections
strong upon him.&nbsp; A narrative so wide awake amidst a vagrant population
of questionable morals and alien race suggests an affinity with <i>Hajji
Baba</i> (a close kinsman, we conceive, of the Borrovian picaro).&nbsp;
But, above all, as one follows the author through the mazes of his book,
one is conscious of two strangely <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>assorted
figures, never far from the itinerant&rsquo;s side, and always ready
to improve the occasion if a shadow of an opportunity be afforded.&nbsp;
One, who is prolific of philological chippings, might be compared to
a semblance of Max M&uuml;ller; while the other, alternately denouncing
the wickedness and deriding the toothlessness of a grim Giant Pope,
may be likened, at a distance, to John Bunyan.&nbsp; About the whole&mdash;to
conclude&mdash;is an atmosphere, not too pronounced, of the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i>, and a few patches of sawdust from the Prize Ring.&nbsp;
May not people well have wondered (the good pious English folk to whom
<i>Luck</i> is a scandal, as the Bible Society&rsquo;s secretary wrote
to Borrow),&mdash;what manner of man is this, this muleteer-missionary,
this natural man with a pen in the hand of a prize-fighter, but of a
prize-fighter who is afflicted with the fads of a philologer&mdash;and
a pedant at that?&nbsp; The surprise may be compared to what that of
a previous generation would have been, had it seen Johnson and Boswell
and Baretti all fused into one man.&nbsp; The incongruity is heightened
by familiarity with Borrow&rsquo;s tall, blonde, Scandinavian figure,
and the reader is reminded of those roving Northmen of the days of simple
medi&aelig;val devotion, who were wont to signalise their conversion
from heathen darkness by a Mediterranean venture, combining the characters
of a piratical cruise and a pious pilgrimage.</p>
<p>That Curiosity exaggerated and was a marvel-monger we shall attempt
to demonstrate.&nbsp; But, in the meantime, it was there, and it was
very strong.&nbsp; As for Borrow, he was prepared to derive stimulus
from it just as long <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>as
it maintained the unquestioning attitude of Jasper Petulengro when he
expressed the sentiments of gipsydom in the well-worn &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,
brother, how learned you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In February 1843 Borrow wrote to Murray that he had begun his <i>Life</i>&mdash;a
&ldquo;kind of biography in the Robinson Crusoe style,&rdquo;&mdash;and
was determined that it should surpass anything that he had already written.&nbsp;
It had been contemplated, he added, for some months already, as a possible
sequel to the <i>Bible in Spain</i> if that proved successful.&nbsp;
Hitherto, he wrote, the public had said &ldquo;Good&rdquo; (to his <i>Gypsies
of Spain</i>, 1841), &ldquo;Better&rdquo; (to the <i>Bible in Spain</i>),
and he wanted it, when No. 3 appeared, to say &ldquo;Best.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Five years rapidly passed away, until, in the summer of 1848, the book
was announced as about to appear shortly, under the title of <i>Lavengro:
An Autobiography</i>, which was soon changed to <i>Life: a Drama</i>.&nbsp;
The difficulty of writing a book which should have &ldquo;no humbug
in it,&rdquo; proved, as may well be supposed, immense, and would in
any case be quite sufficient to account for the long period of gestation.&nbsp;
His perplexities may have often been very near akin to those ascribed
to the superstitious author in the sixty-fifth chapter of <i>Lavengro</i>;
his desire to be original sadly cramping the powers of his mind, his
fastidiousness being so great that he invariably rejected whatever ideas
he did not consider to be legitimately his own.&nbsp; As a substitute
for the usual padding of humbug, sycophancy and second-hand ideas, he
bethought himself of philology, and he set himself <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>to
spring fragments of philological instruction (often far from sound)
upon his reader in the most unexpected places, that his ingenuity could
devise.&nbsp; He then began to base hopes upon the book in proportion
to its originality.&nbsp; At the last moment, however, the Author grew
querulous about his work, distrustful of the reception that would be
given to it, and even as to the advisability of producing it at all.&nbsp;
Much yet remained to be done, but for a long time he refused, not only
to forward new copy to Albemarle Street, but even to revise the proofs
of that which he had already written, and it required all the dunning
that Murray and the printer Woodfall dare apply before <i>Lavengro</i>
with its altered sub-title (for at the last moment Borrow grew afraid
of openly avowing his identity with the speaking likeness which he had
created) could be announced as &ldquo;just ready&rdquo; in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
of Dec. 14th, 1850.</p>
<p><i>Lavengro; the Scholar</i>, <i>the Gypsy</i>, <i>the Priest</i>,
eventually appeared in three volumes on Feb. 7th, 1851.&nbsp; The autobiographical
<i>Lavengro</i> stopped short in July 1825, at the conclusion of the
hundredth chapter, with an abruptness worthy of the <i>Sentimental Journey</i>.&nbsp;
The Author had succeeded in extending the area of mystery, but not in
satisfying the public.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s confidences were so very
different in complexion from those which the critics seemed to have
expected, that they were taken aback and declared to the public almost
with one accord that the writer&rsquo;s eccentricities had developed
into mannerisms, that his theories of life were political manifestoes,
that his dialects were gibberish, and his <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>defiance
of the orthodox canons of autobiography scarcely less than an outrage
upon the public taste.</p>
<p>From the general public came a fusillade of requests to solve the
prevailing mystery of the book.&nbsp; Was it fact or fiction?&mdash;or,
if fact and fiction were blended, in what proportions?&nbsp; Borrow
ought to have been prepared for a question so natural in the mouths
of literary busy-bodies at any time, and especially at a time when partisan
spirit was rampant, and the vitality of the lampoon as a factor in politics
so far from extinct.&nbsp; To show his contempt alike for the critical
verdict and the popular curiosity, after a quarrel, or at least a sharp
coolness with John Murray, he published in two volumes, in May 1857,
<i>The Romany Rye</i>, which carries on the story of <i>Lavengro</i>
for just about a month further, namely, down towards the end of August
1825, and there again stops dead.&nbsp; Whether we regard coherence
or the rate of progress, no more attempt at amendment is perceptible
than can be discerned in the later as compared with the earlier volumes
of <i>Tristram Shandy</i>.&nbsp; The peculiarities of the earlier volume
are, indeed, here accentuated, while the Author had evidently only been
confirmed by the lapse of years in the political philosophy to which
he had already given expression.&nbsp; At the end was printed an appendix
(a sort of <i>catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i> of Borrovian prejudices),
satirising with unmeasured bitterness the critics of <i>Lavengro</i>.</p>
<p>The resumption of a story after an interval of over six years, with
appendages so extravagant, whether we regard their tenor or their length,
and with an indifference <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>so
sublime to the popular desire that he should get along with his personal
narrative, was hardly calculated to conciliate critical opinion; but
it had one capital effect.&nbsp; It drew from Whitwell Elwin, himself
a Norfolk man, and a literary critic of the widest grasp and knowledge,
this remarkable testimony: that far from exaggerating such incidents
as were drawn from his own experience (not a few, as he himself could
verify), Borrow&rsquo;s descriptions were rather <i>within the truth
than beyond it</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;However picturesquely they may be drawn,
the lines are invariably those of nature. . . .&nbsp; There can be no
doubt that the larger part, and possibly the whole of the work, is a
narrative of actual occurrences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, is the heart of the mystery, or of the mystery that is
apparent; the phenomenon is due primarily to the fact that Borrow&rsquo;s
book is so abnormally true as regards the matter, while in manner of
presentation it is so strikingly original.&nbsp; There are superficial
traces, no doubt, of not a few writers of the eighteenth century.&nbsp;
In some of his effects Borrow reproduces Sterne: essentially Sternean,
for instance, is the interview between the youthful author and the experienced
Mr. Taggart.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Well, young gentleman,&rdquo; said Taggart to
me one morning when we chanced to be alone, a few days after the affair
of cancelling, &ldquo;how do you like authorship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely call authorship the drudgery I am engaged in,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call authorship?&rdquo; said Taggart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;that is, I can scarcely
express what I think it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>&ldquo;Shall
I help you out?&rdquo; said Taggart, turning round his chair, and looking
at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To write something grand,&rdquo; said Taggart, taking snuff;
&ldquo;to be stared at&mdash;lifted on people&rsquo;s shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is something like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you write something
grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Taggart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there are those ballads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those wonderful versions from Ab Gwilym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be very fond of snuff,&rdquo; said I, looking
at him angrily.</p>
<p>Taggart tapped his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you taken it long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-and-twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What snuff do you take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Universal Mixture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you find it of use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart tapped his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what respect?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In many&mdash;there is nothing like it to get a man through;
but for snuff I should scarcely be where I am now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been long here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-and-twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and snuff brought you through?&nbsp;
Give me a pinch&mdash;pah, I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; and I sneezed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take another pinch,&rdquo; said Taggart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like snuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will never do for authorship; at least for this kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I begin to think.&nbsp; What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Taggart
took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking of a great work.&nbsp; What shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could write one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart uplifted his two forefingers as if to tap; he did not, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would require time,&rdquo; said I, with half a sigh.</p>
<p>Taggart tapped his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal of time.&nbsp; I really think that my ballads&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If published, would do me credit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make an
effort, and offer them to some other publisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took a double quantity of snuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equally Sterne-like is the conclusion to a chapter: &ldquo;Italy&mdash;what
was I going to say about Italy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Less superficial is the influence of Cervantes and his successors
of the Picaresque school, down to the last and most representative of
them in England, namely Defoe and Smollett.&nbsp; Profoundest of all,
perhaps, is the influence of Defoe, of whose powers of intense realisation,
exhibited in the best parts of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, we get a fine
counterpart amid the outcasts in Mumper&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp; Bound up
with the truthfulness and originality of the Author is that strange
absence of sycophancy, which we may flatter ourselves is no exceptional
thing, but which is in reality a very rare phenomenon in literature.</p>
<p>Apart from this independence of character which he so justly prized,
and a monomania or two, such as his devotion to philology or detestation
of popery, Borrow&rsquo;s mental peculiarities are not by any means
so extravagant as has been supposed.&nbsp; His tastes were <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>for
the most part not unusual, though they might be assorted in a somewhat
uncommon manner.&nbsp; He was a thorough sportsman in the best sense,
but he combined with his sporting zeal an instinctive hatred of gambling,
of bad language, and of tyranny or cruelty in any form.&nbsp; He entertained
a love for the horse in the stable without bowing down to worship the
stage-coachmen, the jockeys, and other ignoble heroes of &ldquo;horsey&rdquo;
life.&nbsp; He loved his country and &ldquo;the quiet, unpretending
Church of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was ready to exalt the obsolescent
fisticuffs and the &ldquo;strong ale of Old England,&rdquo; but he was
not blind either to the drunkenness or to the overbearing brutality
which he had reason to fear might be held to disfigure the character
of the swilling and prize-fighting sections among his compatriots. <a name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a">{20a}</a></p>
<p>Borrow was a master of whim; but it is easy to exaggerate his eccentricity.&nbsp;
As a traveller who met with adventures upon the roads of Britain he
was surpassed by a dozen writers that could be named, and in our own
day&mdash;to mention one&mdash;by that truly eccentric being &ldquo;The
Druid.&rdquo; <a name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b">{20b}</a>&nbsp;
The Druid had a special affinity with Borrow, in regard to his kindness
for an old <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>applewoman.&nbsp;
His applewoman kept a stall in the Strand to which the Druid was a constant
visitor, mainly for the purpose of having a chat and borrowing and repaying
small sums, rarely exceeding one shilling.&nbsp; As an author, again,
Borrow was as jealous as one of Thackeray&rsquo;s heroines; he could
hardly bear to hear a contemporary book praised.&nbsp; Whim, if you
will, but scarcely an example of literary eccentricity.</p>
<p>Borrow developed a delightful faculty for adventure upon the high
road, but such a faculty was far less singular than his gift&mdash;akin
to the greatest painter&rsquo;s power of suggesting atmosphere&mdash;of
investing each scene and incident with a separate and distinct air of
uncompromising reality.&nbsp; Many persons may have had the advantage
of hearing conversation as brilliant or as wise as that of the dinner
at Dilly&rsquo;s: what is distinctive of genius is the power to convey
the general feeling of the interlocutors, to suggest a dramatic effect,
an artistic whole, as Boswell does, by the cumulative effect of infinitesimal
factors.&nbsp; The triumph in each case is one not of opportunities
but of the subtlest literary sense.</p>
<p>Similarly, Borrow&rsquo;s fixed ideas had little that was really
exceptional or peculiar about them.&nbsp; His hatred of mumbo-jumbo
and priestcraft was but a part of his steady love of freedom and sincerity.&nbsp;
His linguistic mania had less of a philological basis than he would
have us believe.&nbsp; Impatience that Babel should act as a barrier
between kindred souls, an insatiable curiosity, prompted by the knowledge
that the language of <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>minorities
was in nine cases out of ten the direct route to the heart of the secret
of folks that puzzled him&mdash;such were the motives that stimulated
a hunger for strange vocabularies, not in itself abnormal.&nbsp; The
colloquial faculty which he undoubtedly possessed&mdash;for we are told
by Taylor that when barely eighteen he already knew English, Welsh,
Irish, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, Danish, French, Italian, and Portuguese&mdash;rarely
goes with philological depth any more than with idiomatic purity.&nbsp;
Borrow learnt some languages to translate, many to speak imperfectly.
<a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22">{22}</a></p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>But
as a comparative philologist, with claims to scientific equipment, his
<i>Targum</i>, with its boasted versions from thirty languages or dialects,
pales considerably before the almost contemporary <i>Philological Grammar</i>,
based upon a comparison of over sixty tongues, by the Dorset poet William
Barnes, who, like Borrow himself, was a self-taught man.&nbsp; To mention
but two more English contemporaries of Borrow, there was Thomas Watts,
of the British Museum, who could read nearly fifty languages, including
Chinese; and Canon Cook, the editor of the <i>Speaker&rsquo;s Commentary</i>,
who claimed acquaintance with fifty-four.&nbsp; It is commonly said
of Cardinal Mezzofanti that he could speak thirty and understand sixty.&nbsp;
It is quite plain from the pages of <i>Lavengro</i> itself that Borrow
did not share Gregory XVI.&rsquo;s high estimate of the Cardinal&rsquo;s
mental qualifications, unrivalled linguist though he was.&nbsp; That
a &ldquo;word-master&rdquo; so abnormal is apt to be deficient in logical
sense seems to have been Borrow&rsquo;s deliberate opinion (with a saving
clause as to exceptions), and I have often thought that it must have
been Shakespeare&rsquo;s too, for does he not ascribe a command of tongues
to the man who is perhaps the most consummate idiot in the whole range
of Shakespearean portraiture?</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp;
That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it
yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in here to be her

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Toby Belch</span>.&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Sir Andrew
Ague-cheek?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.&nbsp; Ay, he.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Toby</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s as tall a man

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Toby</span>.&nbsp; Fie that you&rsquo;ll
say so!&nbsp; He plays o&rsquo; the viol de gamboys, and speaks three
or four languages word for word, without book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary linguistic gifts of a Mezzofanti were not, it is
true, concentrated in Borrow (whose powers in this direction have been
magnified), but they were sufficiently prominent in him to have a determining
effect upon his mind.&nbsp; Thus he was distinguished less for broad
views than for an extraordinary faculty for detail; when he attempts
to generalise we are likelier to get a flood of inconsequent prejudices
than a steady flow of reasoned opinions.</p>
<p>We can frequently study an author with good effect through the medium
of his literary admirations; we have already noticed a few of Borrow&rsquo;s
predilections in real life.&nbsp; With regard to literature, his predilections
(or more particularly what Zola would call his <i>haines</i>) were fully
as protestant and as thorough.&nbsp; His indifference to the literature
of his own time might be termed brutal; his intellectual self-sufficiency
was worthy of a Macaulay or of a Donne.&nbsp; A fellow-denouncer of
snobs, he made <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Thackeray
very uncomfortable by his contemptuous ignorance of <i>The Snob Papers</i>,
and even of the name of the periodical in which they were appearing.&nbsp;
Concerning Keats he once asked, &ldquo;Have they not been trying to
resuscitate him?&rdquo;&nbsp; When Miss Strickland wanted to send him
her Lives, he broke out: &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t, madam;
I should not know where to put them or what to do with them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s <i>Woodstock</i> he picked up more than once and incontinently
threw down as &ldquo;trashy.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a general rule he judged
a modern author by his prejudices.&nbsp; If these differed by a hair&rsquo;s
breadth from his own he damned the whole of his work.&nbsp; He had to
his credit a vast fund of quaint out-of-the-way reading; not to be acquainted
with this was dense unpardonable ignorance: what he had not read was
scarcely knowledge.&nbsp; He was not what one could fairly call unread
in the classical authors, for in a survey of his reviewers he compared
himself complacently enough with Cervantes, Bunyan and Le Sage.&nbsp;
He had the utmost suspicion of literary models; to try to be like somebody
else was the too popular literary precept that he held in the greatest
abhorrence.&nbsp; The gravity of his prescription of Wordsworth as a
specific in cases of chronic insomnia is probably due rather to the
thorough sincerity of his view than to any conscious subtlety of humour.&nbsp;
He disliked Scott especially for his easy tolerance of Jacobites and
Papists, <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25">{25}</a> while
he <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>distrusted
his portraits, those portraits of the rougher people which may have
frequently been over-praised by Scott&rsquo;s admirers.&nbsp; We most
of us love Scott, it is a fact, beyond the power of nice discrimination.&nbsp;
As to the verisimilitude of a portrait such as that of Meg Merrilies
we must allow Borrow to be a most competent critic, but we are at a
loss to sympathise with his failure to appreciate studies of such lifelike
fidelity as Edie Ochiltree and Andrew Fairservice, whose views anent
&ldquo;the muckle hure that sitteth on seven hills, as if ane wasna
braid eneugh for her auld hinder end,&rdquo; had so much that was in
sympathy with Borrow&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>Of all such prejudices and peculiarities, no less than of his gifts,
Borrow was ridiculously proud.&nbsp; In certain respects he was as vainly,
querulously, and childishly assertive as Goldsmith himself; while in
the haughty self-isolation with which he eschewed the society of <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>people
with endowments as great or even greater than his own, he was quite
the opposite of &ldquo;poor Goldy.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the latter had regarded
his interlocutors straight in the eyes with a look that told them he
was prepared to knock them down at a moment&rsquo;s notice upon the
least provocation, we should probably have heard less of his absurdities.&nbsp;
A man who even in his old age could walk off with E. J. Trelawny <a name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a">{27a}</a>
under his arm (as Mr. Watts-Dunton assures us Borrow could) was certainly
not one to be trifled with.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s absolute unconventionality was of course an offence
to many; to Englishmen, who were dreaming in the fifties of a kind of
industrial millennium, with Cobden as the prophet and Macaulay as the
preacher of a new gospel of commercial prosperity and universal peace
and progress, Borrow&rsquo;s pre-railroad prejudices and low tastes
appeared obscurantist, dark, squalid, unintelligible. <a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b">{27b}</a>&nbsp;
He ran out his books upon a line directly <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>counter
to the literary current of the day, and, naturally enough, the critical
billow broke over him.</p>
<p>Hazlitt&rsquo;s proposition&mdash;so readily accepted by the smug
generation of his day&mdash;that London was the only place in which
the child could grow up completely into the man&mdash;would have appeared
the most perverse kind of nonsense to Borrow.&nbsp; The complexity of
a modern type, such as that of a big organiser of industrial labour,
did not impress him.&nbsp; He esteemed the primitive above the economic
man, and was apt to judge a human being rather as Robinson Crusoe might
have done than in the spirit of a juryman at an Industrial Exhibition.&nbsp;
Again, his feeling for nature was intimate rather than enthusiastic,
at a time when people still looked for a good deal of pretty Glover-like
composition in their landscapes.</p>
<p>One of the most original traits of Borrow&rsquo;s genius was the
care and obstinacy with which he defended his practical, vigorous and
alert personality against the allurements of word-painting, of Nature
and of Reverie.&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>He
could respond to the thrill of natural beauty, he could enjoy his mood
when it veritably came upon him, just as he could enjoy a tankard of
old ale or linger to gaze upon a sympathetic face; but he refused to
pamper such feelings, still more to simulate them; he refused to allow
himself to become the creature of literary or poetic ecstasy; he refused
to indulge in the fashionable debauch of dilettante melancholy.&nbsp;
He wrote about his life quite naturally, &ldquo;as if there were nothing
in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another and closely allied cause of perplexity and
discontent to the literary connoisseurs was Borrow&rsquo;s lack of style.&nbsp;
By style, in the generation of Macaulay and Carlyle, of Dickens and
George Eliot, was implied something recondite&mdash;a wealth of metaphor,
imagery, allusion, colour and perfume&mdash;a palette, a pounce-box,
an optical instrument, a sounding-board, a musical box, anything rather
than a living tongue.&nbsp; To a later race of stylists, who have gone
as far as Samoa and beyond in the quest of exotic perfumery, Borrow
would have said simply, in the words of old Montaigne, &ldquo;To smell,
though well, is to stink,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Malo, quam bene olere,
nil olere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow, in fact, by a right instinct went back
to the straightforward manner of Swift and Defoe, Smollett and Cobbett,
whose vigorous prose he specially admired; and he found his choice ill
appreciated by critics whose sense of style demanded that a clear glass
window should be studded with bull&rsquo;s-eyes.&nbsp; To his distinctions
of being a poet well-nigh incapable of verse, and a humourist with marvellously
little pathos, <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Borrow
thus added one which we are inclined to regard as the greatest of all&mdash;that
of being a great nineteenth-century prose-writer without a style.</p>
<p>Though he did not elaborate, or strive to attain to the cultism or
polite style of contemporary genius, Borrow seems to have written with
some difficulty (or at any rate a lack of facility), and, impervious
as he was to criticism, he retained in his prose a number of small faults
that he might easily have got rid of.&nbsp; His manner of introducing
his generalities and conclusions is often either superfluous, or lame
and clumsy.&nbsp; Despite his natural eloquence, his fondness for the
apostrophe is excessive; he preserved an irritating habit of parading
such words as <i>&eacute;clat</i>, <i>penchant</i> and <i>monticle</i>,
and persisted in saying &ldquo;of a verity,&rdquo; and using the word
&ldquo;individual&rdquo; in the sense of person.&nbsp; Such blemishes
are microscopic enough.&nbsp; It was not such trifles as these that
proved stumbling-blocks to the &ldquo;men of blood and foam,&rdquo;
as he called his critics.</p>
<p>Of the generality of the critics of that day it would probably be
well within the mark to aver that their equipment was more solid, and
their competence more assured than that of their successors; <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30">{30}</a>
it would be <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>safe
to assert that their self-sufficiency was also decidedly more pronounced.&nbsp;
Now for reasons which we have endeavoured to explain, the equanimity
of the critical reviewers was considerably ruffled by <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp;
Perplexed by its calling itself an autobiography, they were at the same
time discontented both with its subject-matter and its style.&nbsp;
To a not altogether misplaced curiosity on the part of the public as
to Borrow&rsquo;s antecedents, the author of the <i>Bible in Spain</i>
had responded by <i>Lavengro</i>, which he fully meant to be (what it
indeed was) a masterpiece.&nbsp; Yet public and critics were agreed
in failing to see the matter in this light.&nbsp; As the reader will
probably have deduced from the foregoing pages, the trouble was mainly
due to the following causes.&nbsp; First, baffled curiosity.&nbsp; Secondly,
a dislike for Borrow&rsquo;s prejudices.&nbsp; Thirdly, <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>a
disgust at his philistinism in refusing to bow down and worship the
regnant idols of &lsquo;taste.&rsquo;&nbsp; Fourthly, the total absence
in Borrow of the sentimentality for which the soul of the normal Englishman
yearns.&nbsp; Fifthly, disappointment at not finding the critic&rsquo;s
due from an accepted author in quotable passages of picturesque prose.</p>
<p>These views are appropriately summed up through the medium of the
pure and scentless taste of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp; The varied
contents of <i>Lavengro</i> are here easily reduced to one denomination&mdash;&rsquo;balderdash,&rsquo;
for the emission of which the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> critic proceeds
(in the interests, of course, of the highest gentility), to give George
Borrow a good scolding.</p>
<p>How sadly removed was such procedure from Borrow&rsquo;s own ideal
of reviewing, as set forth in the very volume under consideration!&nbsp;
Such operations should always, he held, be conducted in a spirit worthy
of an editor of Quintilian, in a gentlemanly, Oxford-like manner.&nbsp;
No vituperation!&nbsp; No insinuations!&nbsp; Occasionally a word of
admonition, but gently expressed as an Oxford M.A. might have expressed
it.&nbsp; Some one had ventured to call the <i>Bible in Spain</i> a
grotesque book, but the utterance had been drowned in the chorus of
acclamation.&nbsp; Now Borrow complained that he had had the honour
of being rancorously abused by every unmanly scoundrel, every sycophantic
lacquey, and every political and religious renegade in the kingdom.&nbsp;
His fury was that of an angry bull tormented by a swarm of gnats.&nbsp;
His worst passions were aroused; <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>his
most violent prejudices confirmed.&nbsp; His literary zeal, never extremely
alert, was sensibly diminished.</p>
<p>This last result at least was a calamity.&nbsp; Nevertheless the
great end had, in the main, already been accomplished.&nbsp; Borrow
had broken through the tameness of the regulation literary memoir, and
had shown the naked footprint on the sand.&nbsp; The &lsquo;great unknown&rsquo;
had gone down beneath his associations, his acquirements and his adventures,
and had to a large extent revealed <i>himself</i>&mdash;a primitive
man, with his breast by no means wholly rid of the instincts of the
wild beast, grappling with the problem of a complex humanity: an epitome
of the eternal struggle which alone gives savour to the wearisome process
of &ldquo;civilisation.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the conventional man of the
lapidary phrase and the pious memoir (corrected by the maiden sister
and the family divine), Borrow dared to substitute the <i>genus homo</i>
of natural history.&nbsp; Perhaps it was only to be expected that, like
the discoveries of another Du Chaillu, his revelations should be received
with a howl of incredulity.</p>
<p>Almost alone, as far as we can discover, among the critics of the
day &Eacute;mile Mont&eacute;gut realised <i>to the full</i> the true
greatness, the originality, the abiding quality and interest of Borrow&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; Writing in September 1857 upon &ldquo;Le Gentilhomme Boh&eacute;mien&rdquo;
(an essay which appears in his <i>Ecrivains Modernes de l&rsquo;Angleterre</i>,
between studies on &ldquo;Mistress Browning&rdquo; and Alfred Tennyson),
Mont&eacute;gut remarks of Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;humoristic Odyssey&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Unfinished and fragmentary, these writings can
dispense <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>with
a conclusion, for they have an intrinsic value, and each page bears
the impress of reality.&nbsp; The critic who has to give his impressions
of one of Borrow&rsquo;s books is in much the same case as a critic
who had to give his impressions in turn of the different parts of <i>Gil
Blas</i> as they successively appeared.&nbsp; The work is incomplete,
but each several part is excellent and can be appreciated by itself.&nbsp;
Borrow has resuscitated a literary form which had been many years abandoned,
and he has resuscitated it in no artificial manner&mdash;as a rhythmical
form is rehabilitated, or as a dilettante re-establishes for a moment
the vogue of the roundel or the virelay&mdash;but quite naturally as
the inevitable setting for a picture which has to include the actors
and the observations of the author&rsquo;s vagabond life.&nbsp; To a
clear and unprejudiced mind, observation of the life of the common folk
and, above all, of the itinerant population and of their equivocal moral
code, of necessity and invariably, compels resort to the form and manner
of the <i>nov&eacute;la picaresca</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The huge sensational romance [Sue], the creaking machinery
of melodrama [Boucicault], with which it has been attempted in our own
day to portray certain tableaux of the life of the people, only succeed,
owing to the extravagance of their construction, in demonstrating the
complete ignorance on the part of the writers of the subject which they
pretend to describe.&nbsp; Borrow has not of set purpose adopted the
picaresque form: search his pages where you will, you will find not
a trace of such an intention.&nbsp; He has rediscovered the picaresque
method, as it were instinctively, by the mere fact of his having to
express sentiments of a certain description; he has indeed rediscovered
it by the same process which led Cervantes and Hurtado de Mendoza to
invent it&mdash;by virtue of that necessity which always enables genius
to give the most appropriate clothing to its conceptions.&nbsp; To attain
this result, however, it is necessary that genius should not be thrown
off its balance by deliberate ambition, <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>or
too much preoccupied by the immediate desire to succeed.&nbsp; By his
conformity to all these conditions, Borrow has become, without giving
a thought to such purpose, the Quevedo and the Mendoza of modern England.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond all this there is quite another and perhaps an even more potent
reason why the critics of a later generation have felt constrained to
place this work of Borrow&rsquo;s upon a higher pedestal than their
predecessors did.</p>
<p>As within the four angles of a painting there is nothing more difficult
to confine than sunlight and atmosphere, so in literature is it a task
of the highest achievement to compass the wind on the heath, the sunshine
and the rain.&nbsp; We know the dark background, the mystery and the
awe of the forest, how powerfully they are suggested to us by some old
writers and some modern ones, such as Spenser and Fouqu&eacute;, by
the author of <i>The Pathfinder</i> and Thoreau; the scent of the soil,
once again, in rain and in shine, is it not conveyed to us with an astonishing
distinctness, that is the product of a literary endowment of the rarest
order, by such writers as Izaak Walton and Robert Burns, and among recent
writers in varying degrees by Richard Jefferies and by Barnes, by T.
E. Brown and Thomas Hardy?&nbsp; And then there is the kindred touch,
hardly if at all less rare, which evokes for us the camaraderie and
blithe spirit of the highway: the winding road, the flashing stream,
the bordering coppice, the view from the crest, the twinkling lights
at nightfall from the sheltering inn.&nbsp; Traceable in a long line
of our <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>most
cherished writers, from Chaucer and Lithgow and Nash, Defoe and Fielding,
and Hazlitt and Holcroft, the fascination of the road that these writers
have tried to communicate, has never perhaps been expressed with a nicer
discernment than in the <i>Confessions</i> of Rousseau, that inveterate
pedestrian who walked Europe to the rhythm of ideas as epoch-making
as any that have ever emanated from the mind of man.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La chose que je regrette le plus&rdquo; (writes
Rousseau) &ldquo;dans les details de ma vie dont j&rsquo;ai perdu la
m&eacute;moire, est de n&rsquo;avoir pas fait des journaux de mes voyages.&nbsp;
Jamais je n&rsquo;ai tant pens&eacute;, tant exist&eacute;, tant v&eacute;cu,
tant &eacute;t&eacute; moi, si j&rsquo;ose ainsi dire, que dans ceux
que j&rsquo;ai faits seul et &agrave; pied.&nbsp; La marche a quelque
chose qui anime et avive mes id&eacute;es: je ne puis presque penser
quand je reste en place; il faut que mon corps soit en branle pour y
mettre mon esprit.&nbsp; La vue de la campagne, la succession des aspects
agr&eacute;ables, le grand air, le grand app&eacute;tit, la bonne sante
que je gagne en marchant, la libert&eacute; du cabaret, l&rsquo;&eacute;loignement
de tout ce qui me fait sentir ma d&eacute;pendance, de tout ce qui me
rappelle &agrave; ma situation: tout cela d&eacute;gage mon &acirc;me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a possession in a rare degree of this wonderful open-air quality
as a writer that constrains us in our generation to condone any offences
against the mint and anise and cummin decrees of literary infallibility
that Borrow may have from time to time committed.&nbsp; And when it
is realised, in addition, what a unique knowledge he possessed of the
daily life, the traditions, the folk-lore, and the dialects of the strange
races of vagrants, forming such a picturesque element in the life of
the road, the documentary value, as apart from the <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>literary
interest of Borrow&rsquo;s work, becomes more and more manifest.</p>
<p><i>Lavengro</i> is not a book, it is true, to open sesame to the
first comer, or to yield up one tithe of its charm upon a first acquaintance.&nbsp;
Yet, in spite of the &ldquo;foaming vipers,&rdquo; as Borrow styles
his critics, <i>Lavengro&rsquo;s</i> roots have already struck deep
into the soil of English literature, as Dr. Hake predicted that they
would. <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37">{37}</a>&nbsp;
We know something about the dim retreating Arcady from Dr. Jessopp,
we know something of the old farmers and tranters and woodlanders from
Hardy, something of late Georgian London from Dickens, something of
the old Lancashire mill-hands from Mrs. Gaskell, and something of provincial
town-life in the forties and fifties from George Eliot.&nbsp; It has
fallen to Borrow to hold up the mirror to wild Nature on the roadside
and the heath.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The personages in these inimitable books are not
merely snap-shots, they are living pictures; and, more than that, the
people are moving about amid fluttering leaves and flickering sunlight
and waves of shadow and rippling brooks.&nbsp; One neither misses the
colours of the landscapes nor the very sounds of the voices.&nbsp; Moreover,
the characters, though we <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>feel
that they have never come within the range of our experience, yet did
actually live and move and talk as they are represented; and we know,
too, that such characters have passed away from our earth&mdash;improved
off the face of it.&nbsp; And we regret, in spite of ourselves, that
these gypsies are gone.&nbsp; The rogues will never come back!&nbsp;
A feeling of disappointment is apt to come over us as we read, and we
are ready to stop and ask angrily, &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t we drop in
among the tents, and see an Ursula or a Pakomovna, and have our fortunes
told as of yore?&rsquo;&nbsp; And we know that it cannot be, and that
the Romany Rye is a being who lived and moved in a different age from
ours, as different as the age of Hector and Achilles, when warriors
fought in their chariots round the walls of Troy, and the long-haired
Achaians hurled their spears and stole one another&rsquo;s horses in
the darkness, and kings made long speeches armed to the teeth, and ran
away with other kings&rsquo; wives or multiplied their own.&nbsp; We
go on to confess to ourselves that we must be content with hearing about
all the strange experience of the Romany Rye at second-hand, and since
it must be so, we shall do well to surrender ourselves to such a magician
as this and make the best of it.&rdquo; <a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38">{38}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the publication of the <i>Romany Rye</i> in 1857, Borrow made
one more contribution to Belles Lettres in the book called <i>Wild Wales</i>,
issued in three volumes in 1862.&nbsp; It commemorates a journey made
in the summer of 1854, while its heroic championship of the Bardic literature
recalls the earlier enthusiasm for Ab Gwilym.&nbsp; If after his return
from Spain a definite sphere of activity abroad could have been allotted
to Borrow (by preference in the East, as he himself desired), we might
have had <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>from
his pen contributions to the study of Eastern life that would have added
lustre to a group of writers already brilliantly represented in England
by Curzon and Kinglake, Lane and Morier, Palgrave and Burton.&nbsp;
With Burton&rsquo;s love of roving adventure, of strange tongues, and
of anthropology in its widest sense, the author of the <i>Bible in Spain</i>
had many points in common.&nbsp; As it was, the later years of Borrow&rsquo;s
life were spent somewhat moodily, and with some of the mystery of Swift&rsquo;s
or of Rousseau&rsquo;s, at Oulton, near Lowestoft, whence, at Christmas
1874, he sent a message to the neighbouring hermit, Edward Fitzgerald
at Woodbridge, in the vain hope of eliciting a visit. <a name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a">{39a}</a>&nbsp;
His wife, who had been won with her widow&rsquo;s jointure and dower
during the flush of his missionary successes in 1840, died at the end
of January 1869, <a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b">{39b}</a>
and on July 26th, 1881, after years <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>spent
in a strange seclusion at Oulton, tended latterly by his step-daughter
Henrietta, George Borrow was found dead in his bed, dying as he had
lived, alone.&nbsp; Not long after his death, which took place when
he was seventy-eight, Borrow&rsquo;s Oulton home was pulled down.&nbsp;
All that now remains to mark the spot where it once stood are the old
summer-house in which he wrote <i>Lavengro</i>, and the ragged fir-trees
that sighed the requiem of his last hours.&nbsp; Without appealing to
&ldquo;the shires,&rdquo; but in the Eastern counties alone, he has
been commemorated since his death by such writers as Henry Dutt, and
Whitwell Elwin, by Egmont Hake, by Theodore Watts-Dunton, and by Dr.
Jessopp.&nbsp; And now ere the close of the century <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40">{40}</a>
it has fallen to the lot of yet another East Anglian to place a small
stone upon the cairn of George Borrow.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>The two books <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i> are in reality
one work, an unfinished autobiography, commenced upon a moderate and
quite feasible scale; but after about a third of the ground is covered
the scale is enormously increased, the narrative, encumbered by a vast
amount of detail, makes less and less progress, and finally stops short,
without any obvious, but rather <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>a
lame and impotent conclusion, at chapter xlvii. of the <i>Romany Rye</i>,
or chapter cxlvii. of the work considered as one whole.&nbsp; The disproportion
of the scale will be sufficiently indicated when we point out that the
first twenty-two years of the author&rsquo;s life are treated pretty
equally in fifty-seven chapters (i. to lvii.).&nbsp; The remaining ninety
chapters (lviii. to cxlvii.) are wholly taken up by the incidents of
less than four months, the four summer months of 1825.&nbsp; The first
twenty-two years of the author&rsquo;s life are far from commonplace.&nbsp;
The interest is well sustained, but is seldom intense,&mdash;at no point
is the author&rsquo;s memory sufficiently teeming to cause an overflow;
but with the conclusion of his sojourn in London, May 22nd, 1825, commences
an itinerant life, the novelty of which graves every incident in the
most vivid possible manner upon the writer&rsquo;s recollection.&nbsp;
With his emancipation from town life a new graphic impulse is developed.&nbsp;
Borrow seizes a new palette and sets to work with fresher colours upon
a stupendous canvas.&nbsp; This canvas may be described as taking the
form of a triptych.&nbsp; In the first compartment we have the first
sensations of the roadfarer&rsquo;s life and some minor adventures:
a visit to Stonehenge; the strange meeting with a returned convict,
who turns out to be the old applewoman&rsquo;s son; the vignette of
the hostelry, with the figures of the huge fat landlord and the handmaid
Jenny; the visit to the stranger gentleman who protects himself by &ldquo;touching&rdquo;
against evil chance; the interview with the Rev. Mr. Platitude, and
the bargain struck with the travelling tinker, Jack <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Slingsby,
whose stock-in-trade and profession the writer determines to adopt.&nbsp;
Then comes the word-master&rsquo;s detection in his new sphere of life
by the malignant gipsy godmother, Mrs. Herne, from whose remorseless
attempt to poison him he is rescued by the kindly hearted Welsh preacher
Peter Williams and his wife Winifred.&nbsp; In requital he manages to
relieve the good man of a portion of the load of superstitious terror
by which he is burdened.&nbsp; This section of the narrative is terminated
by a graphic description of his renewal of associateship with his old
friend Jasper Petulengro, the satisfaction he gives that worthy for
having been the innocent cause of Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s death, and his
decision to pitch his tent in the dingle.&nbsp; Chapters lviii. to lxxxii.
are taken up with the foregoing incidents, which lead up to the central
episode of the autobiography, the settlement in the dingle, with which
the reader is here presented.&nbsp; This episode, forming the second
panel in the detailed scheme, occupies chapters lxxxiii. to cxvi., but
it is bisected near the middle by the termination of <i>Lavengro</i>
at chapter c.&nbsp; The two parts are united now for the first time,
and are given a prominent setting in relief from the rest of the narrative.&nbsp;
The third compartment of the triptych, which occupies chapters cxvii.
to cxlvii. (that is, chapters xvii. to xlvii. of the <i>Romany Rye</i>),
is devoted to what we may call the horse-dealing episode.&nbsp; After
the loss of Isopel Berners, the Romany Rye, as the author-hero is now
termed, consoles himself by the purchase of a splendid horse, to obtain
which he consents, much <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>against
his will, to accept a loan of &pound;50 from Jasper Petulengro, the
product of that worthy&rsquo;s labours in the prize ring.&nbsp; He travels
across England with the horse, meeting with adventures by the way, narrating
them to others, and obtaining some curious autobiographical narratives
in return.&nbsp; Finally he reaches Horncastle, and sells the animal
at the horse fair there for &pound;150.&nbsp; Here, in August 1825,
the narrative of his life abruptly ends. <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43">{43}</a></p>
<p>It must not be supposed by any means that the interest of Borrow&rsquo;s
two autobiographical volumes is concentrated in the last eighteen chapters
of <i>Lavengro</i> and the first sixteen chapters of the <i>Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp;
The quality of continuity is, it is true, best preserved in the dingle
episode.&nbsp; Artistically the Brynhildic figure of Isopel serves as
the best relief that could be found for Borrow&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Titanic
self.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is undoubtedly a feeling of unity here which
is hardly to be felt in any other part of the Borrovian &ldquo;Odyssey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is nevertheless true that, taken as a whole, a marked characteristic
of the two volumes is the evenness with which the charms are scattered
hither and thither betwixt the four covers.&nbsp; Attractive, therefore,
as the Isopel Berners episode unquestionably is, and convenient as <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>it
is to the reader to have it detached for him in its unity, its perusal
must not be taken for a moment to absolve the lover of good literature
from traversing chapter by chapter, canto by canto, the whole of the
Borrevian epic.&nbsp; It is outside the dingle that he will have to
look for the faithfully described bewilderment of the old applewoman
after the loss of her book, and for the compassionate delineation of
the old man with the bees and the donkey who gave the young Rye to drink
of mead at his cottage, and was unashamed at having shed tears on the
road.&nbsp; The most heroic of the pugilistic encounters takes place,
it is true, in the thick of the dingle, but it is elsewhere that the
reader will have to look for the description of the memorable thrashing
inflicted upon the bullying stage-coachman by the &ldquo;elderly individual&rdquo;
who followed the craft of engraving, and learnt fisticuffs from Sergeant
Broughton.&nbsp; In the same neighbourhood he will find the admirable
vignette of the old man who could read the inscription on Chinese crockery
pots, but could not tell what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, and the life narratives
of the jockey and of the inexpert thimble-rigger, Murtagh, who was imprisoned
three years for interrupting the Pope&rsquo;s game at picquet, but finally
won his way by card-sharping to the very threshold of the Cardinalate.&nbsp;
In the second half of the <i>Romany Rye</i>, too, he will find the noble
apostrophes to youth, and ale, and England, &ldquo;the true country
for adventures,&rdquo; which he will compare, as examples of Borrovian
eloquence, with the stirring description of embattled England in the
third chapter <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of
<i>Lavengro</i>, or the apostrophe to the Irish cob and the Author&rsquo;s
first ride in chapter thirteen.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s is a wonderful book for one to lose one&rsquo;s <i>way</i>
in, among the dense undergrowth, but it is a still grander book for
the reader to lose <i>himself</i> in.&nbsp; In the dingle, best of all,
he can &ldquo;forget his own troublesome personality as completely as
if he were in the depths of the ancient forest along with Gurth and
Wamba.&rdquo;&nbsp; Labyrinthine, however, as the autobiography may
at first sight appear, the true lover of Borrow will soon have little
difficulty in finding the patteran or gypsy trail (for indeed the Romany
element runs persistently as a chorus-thread through the whole of the
autobiographical writings), which serves as a clue to the delights of
which his work is so rich a storehouse.&nbsp; The question that really
exercises Borrovians most is the relative merit of stories and sections
of the narrative&mdash;the comparative excellence of the early &lsquo;life&rsquo;
in <i>Lavengro</i> and of the later detached episodes in the <i>Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; Most are in some sort of agreement as to the supremacy
of the dingle episode, which has this advantage: Borrow is always at
his best when dealing with strange beings and abnormal experiences.&nbsp;
When he is describing ordinary mortals he treats them with coldness
as mere strangers.&nbsp; The commonplace town-dwellers seldom arouse
his sympathy, never kindle his enthusiasm.&nbsp; He is quite another
being when we wander by his side within the bounds of his enchanted
dingle.</p>
<p>This history of certain doings in a Staffordshire dingle, during
the month of July 1825, begins with a battle-royal, <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>which
places Borrow high amongst the narrators of human conflicts from the
days of the Iliad to those of Pierce Egan; yet the chapters that set
forth this episode of the dingle are less concerned with the &ldquo;gestes&rdquo;
than with the sayings of its occupants.&nbsp; Rare, indeed, are the
dramatic dialogues amid the sylvan surroundings of the tree-crowned
hollow, that surpass in interest even the vivid details of the memorable
fray between the flaming tinman and the pugilistic philologer.&nbsp;
Pre-eminent amongst the dialogues are those between the male occupant
of the dingle and the popish propagandist, known as the man in black.&nbsp;
More fascinating still, perhaps, are the word-master&rsquo;s conversations
with Jasper; most wonderful of all, in the opinion of many, is his logomachy
with Ursula under the thorn bush.&nbsp; We shall not readily forget
Jasper&rsquo;s complaints that all the &lsquo;old-fashioned, good-tempered
constables&rsquo; are going to be set aside, or his gloomy anticipations
of the iron roads in which people are to &lsquo;thunder along in vehicles
pushed forward by fire and smoke.&rsquo;&nbsp; As for his comparison
of the gypsies to cuckoos, the roguish charring fellows, for whom every
one has a bad word, yet whom every one is glad to greet once again when
the spring comes round, or Ursula&rsquo;s exposition of gypsy love and
marriage beneath the hedge,&mdash;these are Borrow at his best, as he
is most familiar to us, in the open air among gypsies.&nbsp; With the
popish emissary it is otherwise: his portrait is the creation of Borrow&rsquo;s
most studied hatred.&nbsp; Yet it must be admitted that the man in black
is a triumph of complex characterisation.&nbsp; A joyous liver and an
unscrupulous <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>libertine,
sceptical as Voltaire, as atheistic as a German professor, as practical
as a Jew banker, as subtle as a Jesuit, he has as many ways of converting
the folks among whom he is thrown as Panurge had of eating the corn
in ear.&nbsp; For the simple and credulous&mdash;crosses and beads;
for the hard-hearted and venal&mdash;material considerations; for the
cultured and educated&mdash;a fine tissue of epigrams and anthropology;
for the ladies&mdash;flattery and badinage.&nbsp; A spiritual ancestor
of Anatole France&rsquo;s marvellous full-length figure of Jer&ocirc;me
Coignard, Borrow&rsquo;s conception takes us back first to Rabelais
and secondly to the seventeenth-century conviction of the profound Machiavellism
of Jesuitry.</p>
<p>The man in black and Jasper are great, but the master attraction
of the region that we are to traverse is admittedly Isopel Berners.&nbsp;
It will perhaps be observed that our heroine makes her appearance on
the stage rather more in the fashion of Molly Seagrim than of that other
engaging Amazon of romance, Diana Vernon, whose &ldquo;long hair streaming
in the wind&rdquo; forms one single point of resemblance to our fair
Isopel.&nbsp; In other respects, certainly no two heroines could be
more dissimilar.&nbsp; Unaided even by the slightest assistance from
the graphic arts, the difficulty of picturing the lineaments of this
muscular beauty, as she first burst on the sight of our autobiographer
upon the declivity of the dingle, may be freely confessed, ere an attempt
is made to describe her.&nbsp; We know, however, on the testimony of
a sincere admirer, that she was over six feet high, with loose-flowing,
flaxen hair; that she wore a <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>tight
bodice and a skirt of blue, to match the colour of her eyes; and that
eighteen summers had passed over her head since she first saw the light
in the great house of Long Melford, a nursery in which she learnt to
fear God and take her own part, and a place the very name of which she
came to regard as a synonym for a strong right arm.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
first impression of her was one of immensity; she was big enough, he
said, to have been born in a church; almost simultaneously, he observed
her affinity to those Scandinavian divinities to which he assigned the
first place in the pantheon of his affections.&nbsp; She reminded him,
indeed, of the legendary Ingeborg, queen of Norway.&nbsp; It is remarkable,
and well worth noticing, that the impression that she produced was instantaneous.&nbsp;
Our wanderer had never been impressed in any similar fashion by any
of the gypsy women with whom he was brought into contact, though, as
many a legend and ballad can attest, such women have often exerted extraordinary
attraction over Englishmen of pure blood.&nbsp; But it is evident that
his physical admiration was reserved for a tall blonde of the Scandinavian
type, to which he gave the name of a Brynhilde.&nbsp; Hence, notwithstanding
his love of the economics of gypsy life, his gypsy women are for the
most part no more than scenic characters; they clothe and beautify the
scene, but they have little dramatic force about them.&nbsp; And when
he comes to delineate a heroine, Isopel Berners, she is physically the
very opposite of a Romany chi.</p>
<p>Fewer words will suffice to describe Isopel&rsquo;s first impressions
of her future partner in the dingle.&nbsp; She <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>unmistakably
regarded him as a chaffing fellow who was not quite right in his head;
and there is reason for believing, that, though she came to entertain
a genuine regard for the young &lsquo;squire,&rsquo; her opinions as
to the condition of his brain underwent no sensible modification.&nbsp;
She herself is fairly explicit on this subject: she seems indeed to
have arrived at the deliberate conviction that, if not abnormally selfish,
he was at any rate fundamentally mad; and there was perhaps a germ of
truth in the conclusion, sufficient at any rate to colour Lombroso&rsquo;s
theory of the inherent madness of men of genius.&nbsp; One of the testimonies
that we have as to Borrow&rsquo;s later life at Oulton is to the effect
that he got bewildered at times and fancied himself Wodin; but the substratum
of sanity is strongly exhibited in the remedy which he himself applied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you think I do when I get bewildered after this fashion?&nbsp;
I go out to the sty and listen to the grunting of the pigs until I get
back to myself.&rdquo; <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49">{49}</a></p>
<p>Of Isopel&rsquo;s history we know extremely little, save what she
herself tells us.&nbsp; Her father was an officer <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>who
was killed in a naval action before he could fulfil the promise of marriage
he had made to her mother, a small milliner, who died in the workhouse
at Long Melford within three months of the effort of giving birth to
an amazon so large and so fierce and so well able to take her own part
as Isopel.&nbsp; At fourteen this fine specimen of workhouse upbringing
was placed in service, from which she emancipated herself by knocking
down her mistress.&nbsp; After two years more at the &ldquo;large house&rdquo;
she was once more apprenticed; and this time knocked down her master
in return for an affront.&nbsp; A second return to the workhouse appearing
inadvisable, she traversed the highways of England in various capacities,
and became acquainted with some of those remarkable though obscure characters
who travelled the roads of our country at that period.&nbsp; A sense
of loneliness drove her among unworthy travelling companions, such as
the flying tinker and grey Moll, in whose society she breaks upon our
notice.&nbsp; Some of the vagrants with whom she came into contact had
occasionally attempted to lay violent hands upon her person and effects,
but had been invariably humbled by her without the aid of either justice
or constable.</p>
<p>Of her specific exploits as a bruiser we hear of at least two near
Dover.&nbsp; Once, the cart she and her old mistress travelled with
was stopped by two sailors, who would have robbed and stripped the owners.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me get down,&rdquo; she exclaimed simply, and so saying she
got down, and fought with them both until they turned round and ran
away.&nbsp; On another occasion, while combing out her long hair <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>beneath
a hedge, she was insulted by a jockey.&nbsp; Starting up, though her
hair was unbound, she promptly gave him what he characterised as &ldquo;a
most confounded whopping,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the only drubbing I ever
had in my life; and lor, how with her right hand she fibbed me while
she held me round the neck with her left arm!&nbsp; I was soon glad
to beg her pardon on my knees, which she gave me in a moment when she
saw me in that condition, being the most placable creature in the world,
and not only her pardon but one of the hairs which I longed for, which
I put through a shilling for purposes of pleasant deception at country
fairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hair with the shilling attached to it eventually
became a treasured possession of the Romany Rye.</p>
<p>Rude as some of these characteristics may appear, we are left in
no manner of doubt as to the essential nobility, befitting her name,
of Miss Berners&mdash;her character and bearing.&nbsp; Her carriage,
especially of the neck and shoulders, reminded the postilion of the
Marchioness of ---; and he took her unhesitatingly for a young lady
of high rank and distinction, who had temporarily left her friends,
and was travelling in the direction of Gretna Green with the fortunate
Rye.&nbsp; The word-master, in disabusing the postilion of this idea,
gave utterance to the conviction that he might search the world in vain
for a nature more heroic and devoted.</p>
<p>Like a lady of the highest quality, the beauteous queen of the dingle
was subject to the vapours and to occasional fits of inexplicable weeping;
but as a general rule she shared with Borrow himself a proud contempt
for that <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>mad
puppy gentility, and her predominant characteristic, like his, was the
simplicity that puzzled by reason of its directness and its purity.
<a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52">{52}</a>&nbsp; That these
qualities were not unaccompanied by a considerable amount of hauteur,
is shown by her uncompromising rejection of the ceremonial advances
made to her by that accomplished courtier, the man in black.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lovely virgin,&rdquo; said he, with a graceful
bow and stretching out his hand, &ldquo;allow me to salute your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers,&rdquo;
said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not presume to request to shake hands with you,&rdquo;
said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;I merely wished to be permitted
to salute with my lips the extremities of your two forefingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never permit anything of the kind,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not approve of such unmanly ways.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His importunity is rebuked more forcibly upon another occasion, when
the nymph bids the priest with asperity to &ldquo;hold his mumping gibberish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The striking beauty of Belle, especially that of her blue eyes and
flaxen hair, and the impressiveness of her demeanour, calm and proud,
which compelled the similitude to a serious and queenly heroine, such
as &lsquo;Queen Theresa of Hungary, or Brynhilda, the Valkyrie, the
beloved of Sigurd, the serpent-killer,&rsquo; is emphasised by the contrast
drawn between her and the handsome <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>brunette
Mrs. Petulengro, who is for the nonce subjugated by Isopel&rsquo;s beauty,
and craves the privilege of acting as her tire-woman.</p>
<p>Alas, as is so often the case in life, Lavengro and the reader are
only just beginning to realise the beauty and the value of the &ldquo;bellissima,&rdquo;
as the man in black calls her, when she is on the point of sinking beneath
our horizon, passing away like the brief music of an aubade.</p>
<p>Rapidly, much too rapidly, do we approach that summer dawn when Belle,
dressed neatly and plainly, her hair no longer plaited in Romany fashion
or floating in the wind, but secured by a comb, uncovered no longer,
but wearing a bonnet, her features very pale, allowed her cold hand
to be wrung&mdash;it was for the last time&mdash;by the unconscious
Rye.&nbsp; The latter ascended to the plain and thence looked down towards
the dingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isopel Berners stood at the mouth, the beams
of the early morning sun shone full on her noble face and figure.&nbsp;
I waved my hands towards her, she slowly lifted up her right arm; I
turned away, and never saw Isopel Berners again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly less forlorn is the reader than the philologist when the latter
arrives back at the dingle, after a visit to the tavern two miles away,
to find that the tardily recognised treasure is lost to him for ever,&mdash;resolved
at length, too late, to give over teasing Belle by pretending to teach
her Armenian, determined, when the need is past, to regularise his &ldquo;uncertificated&rdquo;
relations with the glorious damozel, and resigned, when <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>concession
is fruitless, to sink those objections to America which Belle had disavowed,
but which he had been proud to share with disbanded soldiers, sextons,
and excisemen.&nbsp; To this decision his tortuous conferences with
Jasper, and his frank soliloquy in the dingle, had bent him fully forty-eight
hours before Belle&rsquo;s ultimate departure, unwilling though he was
to incur the yoke of matrimony.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I figured myself in America&rdquo; (says he, in
his reverie over the charcoal fire), &ldquo;in an immense forest, clearing
the land destined by my exertions to become a fruitful and smiling plain.&nbsp;
Methought I heard the crash of the huge trees as they fell beneath my
axe; and then I bethought me that a man was intended to marry&mdash;I
ought to marry; and if I married, where was I likely to be more happy
as a husband and a father, than in America, engaged in tilling the ground?&nbsp;
I fancied myself in America engaged in tilling the ground, assisted
by an enormous progeny&mdash;well, why not marry and go and till the
ground in America?&nbsp; I was young, and youth was the time to marry
in and to labour in; I had the use of all my faculties; my eyes, it
is true, were rather dull from early study, but I could see tolerably
well with them and they were not bleared.&nbsp; I felt my arms and thighs
and teeth&mdash;they were strong and sound enough; so now was the time
to labour, to marry, eat strong flesh, and beget strong children&mdash;the
power of doing all this would pass away with youth, which was terribly
transitory.&nbsp; I bethought me that a time would come when my eyes
would be bleared and perhaps sightless; my arms and thighs strengthless
and sapless; when my teeth would shake in my jaws, even supposing they
did not drop out.&nbsp; No going a-wooing then, no labouring, no eating
strong flesh and begetting lusty children then; and <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>I
bethought me how, when all this should be, I should bewail the days
of my youth as misspent, provided I had not in them founded for myself
a home, and begotten strong children to take care of me in the days
when I could not take care of myself; and thinking of these things I
became sadder and sadder, and stared vacantly upon the fire until my
eyes closed in a doze.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is significant that upon his return from the dream that followed
this reverie, the would-be colonist blew upon the embers and filled
and heated the kettle, that he might be able to welcome Isopel with
a cup of the beverage that she loved.&nbsp; It was the newly awakened
Benedick brushing his hat in the morning; but unhappily his conversion
was not so complete as Benedick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Love-making and Armenian
do not go together, and in the colloquy that ensued, Belle could not
feel assured that the man who proposed to conjugate the verb &ldquo;to
love&rdquo; in Armenian, was master of his intentions in plain English.&nbsp;
It was even so.&nbsp; The man of tongues lacked speech wherewith to
make manifest his passion; the vocabulary of the word-master was insufficient
to convince the workhouse girl of one of the plainest meanings a man
can well have.&nbsp; From the banter of the man of learning the queen
of the dingle sought refuge in a precipitate flight.&nbsp; Almost simultaneously
the word-master, albeit with reluctance, decided that it was high time
to give over his &ldquo;mocking and scoffing.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he returned
with this resolve to the dingle, Isopel Berners had quitted it, never
to return.</p>
<p>Yet ever and anon that splendid and pathetic figure <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>will
cross the sky line of his mental vision&mdash;and of ours.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
the image of Isopel Berners came into my mind,&rdquo; and the thought
&ldquo;how I had lost her for ever, and how happy I might have been
with her in the New World.&rdquo;</p>

I&mdash;THE SCHOLAR SAYS GOOD-BYE TO THE GYPSY, AND PITCHES HIS TENT
IN THE DINGLE.</h2>
<p>[In May 1825 our autobiographer, known among the gypsies as the word-master,
decided to leave London, and travelled, partly on foot and partly by
coach, to Amesbury; and then, after two days at Salisbury, struck northwards.&nbsp;
A few days later, in a small beer-house, he met a tinker and his wife;
the tinker was greatly depressed, having recently been intimidated by
a rival, one Bosville, &ldquo;the flaming tinman,&rdquo; and forced
by threats to quit the road.&nbsp; The word-master, who meditated passing
the summer as an amateur vagrant, and had some &pound;15 or &pound;16
in his pocket, conceived the idea of buying the pony-cart, the implements
and the beat of the tinker, one Jack Slingsby, whose face he remembered
having seen some ten years before.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want a home and work,&rdquo;
he said to the tinker.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for a home, I suppose I can contrive
to make a home out of your tent and cart; and as for work, I must learn
to be a tinker; it would not be hard for one of my trade to be a tinker:
what better can I do?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What about the naming tinman?&rdquo;
said the tinker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid on my account,&rdquo;
said the word-master: &ldquo;if I were to meet him, I could easily manage
him one way or the other: I know all kinds of strange words and names,
and, as I told you before, I sometimes hit people when they put me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>He
accordingly purchases Slingsby&rsquo;s property, and further invests
in a waggoner&rsquo;s frock.&nbsp; To the pony he gives the name of
Ambrol, which signifies in gypsy a pear.&nbsp; He spends a first night
under the hedge in a drizzling rain, and then spends two or three days
in endeavouring to teach himself the mysteries of his new trade.&nbsp;
While living in this solitary way he is detected by Mrs. Herne, an old
gypsy woman, &ldquo;one of the hairy ones,&rdquo; as she terms herself,
who carried &ldquo;a good deal of devil&rsquo;s tinder&rdquo; about
with her, and had a bitter grudge against the word-master.&nbsp; She
hated him for having wormed himself, as she fancied, into the confidence
of the gypsies and learned their language.&nbsp; She regarded him further,
as the cause of differences between herself and her sons-in-law&mdash;as
an apple of discord in the Romany camp.&nbsp; She employed her grandchild,
Leonora, to open relations in a friendly way with Lavengro, and then
to persuade him to eat of a &ldquo;drabbed&rdquo; of poisoned cake.&nbsp;
Lavengro was grievously sick, but was saved in the nick of time by the
appearance upon the scene of a Welsh preacher, Peter Williams, and his
wife&mdash;two good souls who wandered over all Wales and the greater
part of England, comforting the hearts of the people with their doctrine,
and doing all the good they could.&nbsp; They never slept beneath a
roof, unless the weather was very severe.&nbsp; The preacher had a heavy
burden upon his mind, to wit, &ldquo;the sin against the Holy Ghost,&rdquo;
committed when he was but a lad.&nbsp; Lavengro journeys for several
days with the preacher and his wife, assuring the former that in common
with most other boys he himself, when of tender years, had committed
twenty such sins and felt no uneasiness about them.&nbsp; The young
man&rsquo;s conversation had the effect of greatly lightening the despair
of the old preacher.&nbsp; The latter begged the word-master to accompany
him into Wales.&nbsp; On the border, however, Lavengro encountered a
gypsy pal of his youthful days, Jasper Petulengro, and turned back with
him.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro informs him of the end of his old enemy, Mrs.
Herne.&nbsp; Baffled in her designs against the stranger, the old woman
had hanged herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You observe, brother,&rdquo; said Petulengro, springing from
his horse, &ldquo;there is a point at present between us.&nbsp; There
can be no doubt that you are the cause of Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s death&mdash;innocently,
you <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>will
say, but still the cause.&nbsp; Now I shouldn&rsquo;t like it to be
known that I went up and down the country with a pal who was the cause
of my mother-in-law&rsquo;s death: that is to say, unless he gave me
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they fell to with their naked fists on
a broad strip of grass in the shade under some lofty trees.&nbsp; In
half an hour&rsquo;s time Lavengro&rsquo;s face was covered with blood,
whereupon Mr. Petulengro exclaimed, &ldquo;Put your hands down, brother:
I&rsquo;m satisfied; blood has been shed, which is all that can be expected
for an old woman who carried so much brimstone about with her as Mrs.
Herne.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>So we resumed our route, Mr. Petulengro sitting sideways on his horse,
and I driving my little pony-cart; and when we had proceeded about three
miles, we came to a small public-house, which bore the sign of the &ldquo;Silent
Woman,&rdquo; where we stopped to refresh our cattle and ourselves;
and as we sat over our bread and ale, it came to pass that Mr. Petulengro
asked me various questions, and amongst others, how I intended to dispose
of myself.&nbsp; I told him that I did not know; whereupon, with considerable
frankness, he invited me to his camp, and told me that if I chose to
settle down amongst them, and become a Rommany chal, <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61">{61}</a>
I should have his wife&rsquo;s sister, Ursula, who was still unmarried,
and occasionally talked of me.</p>
<p>I declined his offer, assigning as a reason the recent death of Mrs.
Herne, of which I was the cause, although innocent.&nbsp; &ldquo;A pretty
life I should lead with those two,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when they came
to know it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;they
will never know it.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t blab, and as for Leonora, that
girl has a head on her <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>shoulder&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Unlike the woman in the sign,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whose head
is cut off.&nbsp; You speak nonsense, Mr. Petulengro: as long as a woman
has a head on her shoulders she&rsquo;ll talk,&mdash;but, leaving women
out of the case, it is impossible to keep anything a secret; an old
master of mine told me so long ago.&nbsp; I have moreover another reason
for declining your offer.&nbsp; I am at present not disposed for society.&nbsp;
I am become fond of solitude.&nbsp; I wish I could find some quiet place
to which I could retire to hold communion with my own thoughts, and
practise, if I thought fit, either of my trades.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What
trades?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the one which
I have lately been engaged in, or my original one, which I confess I
should like better, that of a kaulomescro.&rdquo; <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62">{62}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, I have frequently heard you talk of making horseshoes,&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;I, however, never saw you make one,
and no one else that I am aware, I don&rsquo;t believe.&nbsp; Come,
brother, don&rsquo;t be angry,&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite possible that
you may have done things which neither I nor any one else has seen you
do, and that such things may some day or other come to light, as you
say nothing can be kept secret.&nbsp; Be that, however, as it may, pay
the reckoning, and let us be going.&nbsp; I think I can advise you to
just such a kind of place as you seem to want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know that I have got wherewithal to pay the
reckoning?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, &ldquo;I was just now looking in your face, which exhibited
the very look of a person <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>conscious
of the possession of property; there was nothing hungry or sneaking
in it.&nbsp; Pay the reckoning, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when we were once more upon the road Mr. Petulengro began to
talk of the place which he conceived would serve me as a retreat under
present circumstances.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you frankly, brother, that
it is a queer kind of place, and I am not very fond of pitching my tent
in it, it is so surprisingly dreary.&nbsp; It is a deep dingle in the
midst of a large field, on an estate about which there has been a lawsuit
for some years past.&nbsp; I daresay you will be quiet enough, for the
nearest town is five miles distant, and there are only a few huts and
hedge public-houses in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Brother, I am fond of
solitude myself, but not that kind of solitude: I like a quiet heath,
where I can pitch my house, but I always like to have a gay stirring
place not far off, where the women can pen dukkerin, <a name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a">{63a}</a>
and I myself can sell or buy a horse, if needful&mdash;such a place
as the Chong Gav. <a name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b">{63b}</a>&nbsp;
I never feel so merry as when there, brother, or on the heath above
it, where I taught you Rommany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after this discourse we reached a milestone, and a few yards
from the milestone, on the left hand, was a cross-road.&nbsp; Thereupon
Mr. Petulengro said, &ldquo;Brother, my path lies to the left; if you
choose to go with me to my camp, good; if not, Chal Devlehi.&rdquo;
<a name="citation63c"></a><a href="#footnote63c">{63c}</a>&nbsp; But
I again refused Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s invitation, and, shaking him
by the hand, proceeded <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>forward
alone, and about ten miles farther on I reached the town of which he
had spoken, and following certain directions which he had given, discovered,
though not without some difficulty, the dingle which he had mentioned.&nbsp;
It was a deep hollow in the midst of a wide field, the shelving sides
were overgrown with trees and bushes, a belt of sallows surrounded it
on the top, a steep winding path led down into the depths, practicable,
however, for a light cart, like mine; at the bottom was an open space,
and there I pitched my tent, and there I contrived to put up my forge,
&ldquo;I will here ply the trade of kaulomescro,&rdquo; <a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64">{64}</a>
said I.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE SHOEING OF AMBROL.</h2>
<p>It has always struck me that there is something highly poetical about
a forge.&nbsp; I am not singular in this opinion: various individuals
have assured me that they never pass by one, even in the midst of a
crowded town, without experiencing sensations which they can scarcely
define, but which are highly pleasurable.&nbsp; I have a decided penchant
for forges, especially rural ones placed in some quaint quiet spot&mdash;a
dingle, for example, which is a poetical place, or at a meeting of four
roads, which is still more so; for how many a superstition&mdash;and
superstition is the soul of poetry&mdash;is connected with these cross
roads!&nbsp; I love to light upon such a one, especially after nightfall,
as everything about <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>a
forge tells to most advantage at night; the hammer sounds more solemnly
in the stillness, the glowing particles scattered by the stroke sparkle
with more effect in the darkness, whilst the sooty visage of the sastramescro,
<a name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a">{65a}</a> half in shadow,
and half illumined by the red and partial blaze of the forge, looks
more mysterious and strange.&nbsp; On such occasions I draw in my horse&rsquo;s
rein, and, seated in the saddle, endeavour to associate with the picture
before me&mdash;in itself a picture of romance&mdash;whatever of the
wild and wonderful I have read of in books, or have seen with mine own
eyes in connection with forges.</p>
<p>I believe the life of any blacksmith, especially a rural one, would
afford materials for a highly poetical history.&nbsp; I do not speak
unadvisedly, having the honour to be free of the forge, and therefore
fully competent to give an opinion as to what might be made out of the
forge by some dextrous hand.&nbsp; Certainly, the strangest and most
entertaining life ever written is that of a blacksmith of the olden
north, a certain Volundr, or Velint, <a name="citation65b"></a><a href="#footnote65b">{65b}</a>
who lived in woods and thickets, made keen swords,&mdash;so keen, indeed,
that if placed by a running stream, they would fairly divide an object,
however slight, which was borne against them by the water&mdash;and
who eventually married a king&rsquo;s daughter, by whom he had a son,
who was as bold a knight as his father was a cunning blacksmith.&nbsp;
I never see a forge at night, when seated on the back of my horse at
the bottom of a dark lane, but I somehow or other associate it <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>with
the exploits of this extraordinary fellow, with many other extraordinary
things, amongst which, as I have hinted before, are particular passages
of my own life, one or two of which I shall perhaps relate to the reader.</p>
<p>I never associate Vulcan and his Cyclops with the idea of a forge.&nbsp;
These gentry would be the very last people in the world to flit across
my mind whilst gazing at the forge from the bottom of the dark lane.&nbsp;
The truth is, they are highly unpoetical fellows, as well they may be,
connected as they are with Grecian mythology.&nbsp; At the very mention
of their names the forge burns dull and dim, as if snowballs had been
suddenly flung into it; the only remedy is to ply the bellows, an operation
which I now hasten to perform.</p>
<p>I am in the dingle making a horseshoe.&nbsp; Having no other horses
on whose hoofs I could exercise my art, I made my first essay on those
of my own horse, if that could be called horse which horse was none,
being only a pony.&nbsp; Perhaps if I had sought all England I should
scarcely have found an animal more in need of the kind offices of the
smith.&nbsp; On three of his feet there were no shoes at all, and on
the fourth only a remnant of one, on which account his hoofs were sadly
broken and lacerated by his late journeys over the hard and flinty roads.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You belonged to a tinker before,&rdquo; said I, addressing the
animal, &ldquo;but now you belong to a smith.&nbsp; It is said that
the household of the shoemaker invariably go worse shod than that of
any other craft.&nbsp; That may be the case of those who make shoes
of leather, but it shan&rsquo;t be said of the <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>household
of him who makes shoes of iron; at any rate, it shan&rsquo;t be said
of mine.&nbsp; I tell you what, my gry, <a name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a">{67a}</a>
whilst you continue with me, you shall both be better shod, and better
fed, than you were with your late master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am in the dingle making a petul; <a name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b">{67b}</a>
and I must here observe, that whilst I am making a horseshoe, the reader
need not be surprised if I speak occasionally in the language of the
lord of the horseshoe&mdash;Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; I have for some time
past been plying the peshota, or bellows, endeavouring to raise up the
yag, or fire, in my primitive forge.&nbsp; The angar, or coals, are
now burning fiercely, casting forth sparks and long vagescoe chipes,
or tongues of flame; a small bar of sastra, or iron, is lying in the
fire, to the length of ten or twelve inches, and so far it is hot, very
hot, exceeding hot, brother.&nbsp; And now you see me prala, snatch
the bar of iron, and place the heated end of it upon the covantza, or
anvil, and forthwith I commence cooring <a name="citation67c"></a><a href="#footnote67c">{67c}</a>
the sastra as hard as if I had been just engaged by a master at the
rate of dui caulor, or two shillings a day, brother; and when I have
beaten the iron till it is nearly cool, and my arm tired, I place it
again in the angar, and begin again to rouse the fire with the pudomengro,
which signifies the blowing thing, and is another and more common word
for bellows, and whilst thus employed I sing a gypsy song, the sound
of which is wonderfully in unison with the hoarse moaning of the pudamengro,
and ere the song is finished, the iron is again hot and malleable.&nbsp;
Behold, <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>I
place it once more on the covantza, and recommence hammering; and now
I am somewhat at fault: I am in want of assistance; I want you, brother,
or some one else, to take the bar out of my hand and support it upon
the covantza, whilst I, applying a chinomescro, or kind of chisel, to
the heated iron, cut off with a lusty stroke or two of the shukaro baro,
or big hammer, as much as is required for the petul.&nbsp; But having
no one to help me, I go on hammering till I have fairly knocked off
as much as I want, and then I place the piece in the fire, and again
apply the bellows, and take up the song where I left it off; and when
I have finished the song, I take out the iron, but this time with my
plaistra, or pincers, and then I recommence hammering, turning the iron
round and round with my pincers: and now I bend the iron, and lo, and
behold, it has assumed something the outline of a petul.</p>
<p>I am not going to enter into farther details with respect to the
process&mdash;it was rather a wearisome one.&nbsp; I had to contend
with various disadvantages: my forge was a rude one, my tools might
have been better; I was in want of one or two highly necessary implements,
but, above all, manual dexterity.&nbsp; Though free of the forge, I
had not practised the albeytarian art for very many years, never since&mdash;but
stay, it is not my intention to tell the reader, at least in this place,
how and when I became a blacksmith.&nbsp; There was one thing, however,
which stood me in good stead in my labour, the same thing which through
life has ever been of incalculable utility to me, and has not unfrequently
supplied the <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>place
of friends, money, and many other things of almost equal importance&mdash;iron
perseverance, without which all the advantages of time and circumstances
are of very little avail in any undertaking.&nbsp; I was determined
to make a horseshoe, and a good one, in spite of every obstacle&mdash;ay,
in spite o&rsquo; dukkerin.&nbsp; At the end of four days, during which
I had fashioned and re-fashioned the thing at least fifty times, I had
made a petul such as no master of the craft need have been ashamed of;
with the second shoe I had less difficulty, and, by the time I had made
the fourth, I would have scorned to take off my hat to the best smith
in Cheshire.</p>
<p>But I had not yet shod my little gry; <a name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a">{69a}</a>
this I proceeded now to do.&nbsp; After having first well pared the
hoofs with my churi, <a name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b">{69b}</a>
I applied each petul hot, glowing hot to the pindro. <a name="citation69c"></a><a href="#footnote69c">{69c}</a>&nbsp;
Oh, how the hoofs hissed; and, oh, the pleasant pungent odour which
diffused itself through the dingle, an odour good for an ailing spirit!</p>
<p>I shoed the little horse bravely&mdash;merely pricked him once, slightly
with a cafi, <a name="citation69d"></a><a href="#footnote69d">{69d}</a>
for doing which, I remember, he kicked me down; I was not disconcerted,
however, but, getting up, promised to be more cautious in future; and
having finished the operation, I filed the hoof well with the rin baro;
<a name="citation69e"></a><a href="#footnote69e">{69e}</a> then dismissed
him to graze amongst the trees, and, putting my smaller tools into the
muchtar, <a name="citation69f"></a><a href="#footnote69f">{69f}</a>
I sat down on my stone, and, supporting my arm upon my knee, leaned
my head upon my hand.&nbsp; Heaviness had come over me.</p>
<h2><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>CHAPTER
III&mdash;THE DARK HOUR COMES UPON LAVENGRO AND HIS SOUL IS HEAVY WITHIN
HIM.</h2>
<p>Heaviness had suddenly come over me, heaviness of heart, and of body
also.&nbsp; I had accomplished the task which I had imposed upon myself,
and now that nothing more remained to do, my energies suddenly deserted
me, and I felt without strength and without hope.&nbsp; Several causes,
perhaps, co-operated to bring about the state in which I then felt myself.&nbsp;
It is not improbable that my energies had been overstrained during the
work, the progress of which I have attempted to describe; and everyone
is aware that the results of overstrained energies are feebleness and
lassitude&mdash;want of nourishment might likewise have something to
do with it.&nbsp; During my sojourn in the dingle, my food had been
of the simplest and most unsatisfying description, by no means calculated
to support the exertion which the labour I had been engaged upon required;
it had consisted of coarse oaten cakes and hard cheese, and for beverage
I had been indebted to a neighbouring pit, in which, in the heat of
the day, I frequently saw, not golden or silver fish, but frogs and
eftes swimming about.&nbsp; I am, however, inclined to believe that
Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s cake had quite as much to do with the matter as insufficient
nourishment.&nbsp; I had never entirely recovered from the effects of
its poison, but had occasionally, especially at night, been visited
by <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>a
grinding pain in the stomach, and my whole body had been suffused with
cold sweat; and indeed these memorials of the drow <a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71">{71}</a>
have never entirely disappeared&mdash;even at the present time they
display themselves in my system, especially after much fatigue of body
and excitement of mind.&nbsp; So there I sat in the dingle upon my stone,
nerveless and hopeless, by whatever cause or causes that state had been
produced&mdash;there I sat with my head leaning upon my hand, and so
I continued a long, long time.&nbsp; At last I lifted my head from my
hand, and began to cast anxious, unquiet looks about the dingle&mdash;the
entire hollow was now enveloped in deep shade&mdash;I cast my eyes up;
there was a golden gleam on the tops of the trees which grew towards
the upper parts of the dingle; but lower down, all was gloom and twilight&mdash;yet,
when I first sat down on my stone, the sun was right above the dingle,
illuminating all its depths by the rays which it cast perpendicularly
down&mdash;so I must have sat a long, long time upon my stone.&nbsp;
And now, once more, I rested my head upon my hand, but almost instantly
lifted it again in a kind of fear, and began looking at the objects
before me&mdash;the forge, the tools, the branches of the trees, endeavouring
to follow their rows, till they were lost in the darkness of the dingle.&nbsp;
And now I found my right hand grasping convulsively three forefingers
of the left, first collectively, and then successively, wringing them
till the joints cracked; then I became quiet, but not for long.</p>
<p>Suddenly I started up, and could scarcely repress <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the
shriek which was rising to my lips.&nbsp; Was it possible?&nbsp; Yes,
all too certain: the evil one was upon me; the inscrutable horror which
I had felt in my boyhood had once more taken possession of me.&nbsp;
I had thought that it had forsaken me; that it would never visit me
again; that I had outgrown it; that I might almost bid defiance to it;
and I had even begun to think of it without horror, as we are in the
habit of doing of horrors of which we conceive we run no danger; and
lo! when least thought of, it had seized me again.&nbsp; Every moment
I felt it gathering force, and making me more wholly its own.&nbsp;
What should I do?&mdash;resist, of course; and I did resist.&nbsp; I
grasped, I tore, and strove to fling it from me; but of what avail were
my efforts?&nbsp; I could only have got rid of it by getting rid of
myself: it was a part of myself, or rather it was all myself.&nbsp;
I rushed amongst the trees, and struck at them with my bare fists, and
dashed my head against them, but I felt no pain.&nbsp; How could I feel
pain with that horror upon me! and then I flung myself on the ground,
gnawed the earth, and swallowed it; and then I looked round: it was
almost total darkness in the dingle, and the darkness added to my horror.&nbsp;
I could no longer stay there; up I rose from the ground, and attempted
to escape; at the bottom of the winding path which led up the acclivity
I fell over something which was lying on the ground; the something moved,
and gave a kind of whine.&nbsp; It was my little horse, which had made
that place its lair&mdash;my little horse, my only companion <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>and
friend, in that now awful solitude.&nbsp; I reached the mouth of the
dingle; the sun was just sinking in the far west, behind me; the fields
were flooded with his last gleams.&nbsp; How beautiful everything looked
in the last gleams of the sun!&nbsp; I felt relieved for a moment; I
was no longer in the horrid dingle; in another minute the sun was gone,
and a big cloud occupied the place where he had been; in a little time
it was almost as dark as it had previously been in the open part of
the dingle.&nbsp; My horror increased; what was I to do!&mdash;it was
of no use fighting against the horror&mdash;that I saw; the more I fought
against it, the stronger it became.&nbsp; What should I do? say my prayers?&nbsp;
Ah! why not?&nbsp; So I knelt down under the hedge, and said, &ldquo;Our
Father&rdquo;; but that was of no use; and now I could no longer repress
cries; the horror was too great to be borne.&nbsp; What should I do:
run to the nearest town or village, and request the assistance of my
fellow-men?&nbsp; No! that I was ashamed to do; notwithstanding the
horror was upon me, I was ashamed to do that.&nbsp; I knew they would
consider me a maniac if I went screaming amongst them; and I did not
wish to be considered a maniac.&nbsp; Moreover, I knew that I was not
a maniac for I possessed all my reasoning powers, only the horror was
upon me&mdash;the screaming horror!&nbsp; But how were indifferent people
to distinguish between madness and this screaming horror?&nbsp; So I
thought and reasoned; and at last I determined not to go amongst my
fellow-men, whatever the result might be.&nbsp; I went to the mouth
of the dingle, <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and
there, placing myself on my knees, I again said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer;
but it was of no use; praying seemed to have no effect over the horror;
the unutterable fear appeared rather to increase than diminish; and
I again uttered wild cries, so loud that I was apprehensive they would
be heard by some chance passenger on the neighbouring road; I, therefore,
went deeper into the dingle; I sat down with my back against a thorn
bush; the thorns entered my flesh; and when I felt them, I pressed harder
against the bush; I thought the pain of the flesh might in some degree
counteract the mental agony; presently I felt them no longer; the power
of the mental horror was so great that it was impossible, with that
upon me, to feel any pain from the thorns.&nbsp; I continued in this
posture a long time, undergoing what I cannot describe, and would not
attempt if I were able.&nbsp; Several times I was on the point of starting
up and rushing anywhere; but I restrained myself, for I knew I could
not escape from myself, so why should I not remain in the dingle?&nbsp;
So I thought and said to myself, for my reasoning powers were still
uninjured.&nbsp; At last it appeared to me that the horror was not so
strong, not quite so strong upon me.&nbsp; Was it possible that it was
relaxing its grasp, releasing its prey?&nbsp; O what a mercy! but it
could not be&mdash;and yet I looked up to heaven, and clasped my hands,
and said, &ldquo;Our Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said no more; I was too
agitated; and now I was almost sure that the horror had done its worst.</p>
<p>After a little time I arose, and staggered down yet <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>farther
into the dingle.&nbsp; I again found my little horse on the same spot
as before.&nbsp; I put my hand to his mouth; he licked my hand.&nbsp;
I flung myself down by him and put my arms round his neck; the creature
whinnied, and appeared to sympathize with me; what a comfort to have
any one, even a dumb brute, to sympathize with me at such a moment!&nbsp;
I clung to my little horse, as if for safety and protection.&nbsp; I
laid my head on his neck, and felt almost calm; presently the fear returned,
but not so wild as before; it subsided, came again, again subsided;
then drowsiness came over me, and at last I fell asleep, my head supported
on the neck of the little horse.&nbsp; I awoke; it was dark, dark night&mdash;not
a star was to be seen&mdash;but I felt no fear, the horror had left
me.&nbsp; I arose from the side of the little horse, and went into my
tent, lay down, and again went to sleep.</p>
<p>I awoke in the morning weak and sore, and shuddering at the remembrance
of what I had gone through on the preceding day.&nbsp; The sun was shining
brightly, but it had not yet risen high enough to show its head above
the trees which fenced the eastern side of the dingle, on which account
the dingle was wet and dank, from the dews of the night.&nbsp; I kindled
my fire, and, after sitting by it for some time to warm my frame, I
took some of the coarse food which I have already mentioned; notwithstanding
my late struggle, and the coarseness of the fare, I ate with appetite.&nbsp;
My provisions had by this time been very much diminished, and I saw
that it would be speedily <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>necessary,
in the event of my continuing to reside in the dingle, to lay in a fresh
store.&nbsp; After my meal I went to the pit, and filled a can with
water, which I brought to the dingle, and then again sat down on my
stone.&nbsp; I considered what I should next do: it was necessary to
do something, or my life in this solitude would be unsupportable.&nbsp;
What should I do? rouse up my forge and fashion a horseshoe; but I wanted
nerve and heart for such an employment; moreover, I had no motive for
fatiguing myself in this manner; my own horse was shod, no other was
at hand, and it is hard to work for the sake of working.&nbsp; What
should I do? read?&nbsp; Yes, but I had no other book than the Bible
which the Welsh Methodist had given me: well, why not read the Bible?&nbsp;
I was once fond of reading the Bible; ay, but those days were long gone
by.&nbsp; However, I did not see what else I could do on the present
occasion&mdash;so I determined to read the Bible&mdash;it was in Welsh;
at any rate it might amuse me, so I took the Bible out of the sack,
in which it was lying in the cart, and began to read at the place where
I chanced to open it.&nbsp; I opened it at the part where the history
of Saul commences.&nbsp; At first I read with indifference, but after
some time my attention was riveted.&nbsp; And no wonder: I had come
to the visitations of Saul, those dark moments of his, when he did and
said such unaccountable things; it almost appeared to me that I was
reading of myself; I, too, had my visitations, dark as ever his were.&nbsp;
O, how I sympathized with Saul, the tall dark man!&nbsp; I had read
his life <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>before,
but it had made no impression on me; it had never occurred to me that
I was like him, but I now sympathized with Saul, for my own dark hour
was but recently passed, and, perhaps, would soon return again; the
dark hour came frequently on Saul.</p>
<p>Time wore away; I finished the book of Saul, and, closing the volume,
returned it to its place.&nbsp; I then returned to my seat on the stone,
and thought of what I had read, and what I had lately undergone.&nbsp;
All at once I thought I felt well-known sensations&mdash;a cramping
of the breast, and a tingling of the soles of the feet&mdash;they were
what I had felt on the preceding day; they were the forerunners of the
fear.&nbsp; I sat motionless on my stone; the sensations passed away,
and the fear came not.&nbsp; Darkness was now coming again over the
earth; the dingle was again in deep shade.&nbsp; I roused the fire with
the breath of the bellows, and sat looking at the cheerful glow; it
was cheering and comforting.&nbsp; My little horse came now and lay
down on the ground beside the forge; I was not quite deserted.&nbsp;
I again ate some of the coarse food, and drank plentifully of the water
which I had fetched in the morning.&nbsp; I then put fresh fuel on the
fire, and sat for a long time looking on the blaze; I then went into
my tent.</p>
<p>I awoke, on my own calculation, about midnight&mdash;it was pitch
dark, and there was much fear upon me.</p>
<h2><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>CHAPTER
IV.&mdash;A CLASSICAL ENCOUNTER&mdash;LONG MELFORD TO THE RESCUE.</h2>
<p>Two mornings after the period to which I have brought the reader
in the preceding chapter, I sat by my fire at the bottom of the dingle.&nbsp;
I had just breakfasted, and had finished the last morsel of food which
I had brought with me to that solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I now do?&rdquo; said I to myself: &ldquo;shall
I continue here, or decamp?&nbsp; This is a sad lonely spot&mdash;perhaps
I had better quit it; but whither should I go? the wide world is before
me, but what can I do therein?&nbsp; I have been in the world already
without much success.&nbsp; No, I had better remain here; the place
is lonely, it is true, but here I am free and independent, and can do
what I please; but I can&rsquo;t remain here without food.&nbsp; Well,
I will find my way to the nearest town, lay in a fresh supply of provision,
and come back, turning my back upon the world, which has turned its
back upon me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why I should not write a little
sometimes; I have pens and an ink-horn, and for a writing-desk I can
place the Bible on my knee.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I could
write a capital satire on the world on the back of that Bible; but first
of all I must think of supplying myself with food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rose up from the stone on which I was seated, determining to go
to the nearest town, with my little horse and cart and procure what
I wanted.&nbsp; The nearest <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>town,
according to my best calculation, lay about five miles distant; I had
no doubt, however, that by using ordinary diligence, I should be back
before evening.&nbsp; In order to go lighter, I determined to leave
my tent standing as it was, and all the things which I had purchased
of the tinker, just as they were.&nbsp; &ldquo;I need not be apprehensive
on their account,&rdquo; said I to myself; &ldquo;nobody will come here
to meddle with them&mdash;the great recommendation of this place is
its perfect solitude&mdash;I dare say that I could live here six months
without seeing a single human visage.&nbsp; I will now harness my little
gry and be off to the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a whistle which I gave, the little gry, which was feeding on the
bank near the uppermost part of the dingle, came running to me, for
by this time he had become so accustomed to me that he would obey my
call for all the world as if he had been one of the canine species.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;we are going to the town to
buy bread for myself, and oats for you&mdash;I am in a hurry to be back;
therefore, I pray you to do your best, and to draw me and the cart to
the town with all possible speed, and to bring us back; if you do your
best, I promise you oats on your return.&nbsp; You know the meaning
of oats, Ambrol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ambrol whinnied as if to let me know that he understood me perfectly
well, as indeed he well might, as I had never once fed him during the
time he had been in my possession without saying the word in question
to him.&nbsp; Now, Ambrol, in the Gypsy tongue, signifieth a pear.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>So
I caparisoned Ambrol, and then, going to the cart, removed two or three
things from out it into the tent; I then lifted up the shafts, and was
just going to call to the pony to come and be fastened to them, when
I thought I heard a noise.</p>
<p>I stood stock still, supporting the shaft of the little cart in my
hand, and bending the right side of my face slightly towards the ground;
but I could hear nothing.&nbsp; The noise which I thought I had heard
was not one of those sounds which I was accustomed to hear in that solitude&mdash;the
note of a bird, or the rustling of a bough; it was&mdash;there I heard
it again&mdash;a sound very much resembling the grating of a wheel amongst
gravel.&nbsp; Could it proceed from the road?&nbsp; Oh no, the road
was too far distant for me to hear the noise of anything moving along
it.&nbsp; Again I listened, and now I distinctly heard the sound of
wheels, which seemed to be approaching the dingle; nearer and nearer
they drew, and presently the sound of wheels was blended with the murmur
of voices.&nbsp; Anon I heard a boisterous shout, which seemed to proceed
from the entrance of the dingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here are folks at hand,&rdquo;
said I, letting the shaft of the cart fall to the ground: &ldquo;is
it possible that they can be coming here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My doubts on that point, if I entertained any, were soon dispelled:
the wheels, which had ceased moving for a moment or two, were once again
in motion, and were now evidently moving down the winding path which
led to my retreat.&nbsp; Leaving my cart, I came forward and placed
myself near the entrance of the <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>open
space, with my eyes fixed on the path down which my unexpected and I
may say unwelcome visitors were coming.&nbsp; Presently I heard a stamping
or sliding, as if of a horse in some difficulty; and then a loud curse,
and the next moment appeared a man and a horse and cart; the former
holding the head of the horse up to prevent him from falling, of which
he was in danger, owing to the precipitous nature of the path.&nbsp;
Whilst thus occupied, the head of the man was averted from me.&nbsp;
When, however, he had reached the bottom of the descent, he turned his
head, and perceiving me, as I stood bareheaded, without either coat
or waistcoat, about two yards from him, he gave a sudden start, so violent
that the backward motion of his hand had nearly flung the horse upon
his haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you move forward?&rdquo; said a voice from
behind, apparently that of a female; &ldquo;you are stopping up the
way, and we shall be all down upon one another;&rdquo; and I saw the
head of another horse overtopping the back of the cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you move forward, Jack?&rdquo; said another
voice, also of a female, yet higher up the path.</p>
<p>The man stirred not, but remained staring at me in the posture which
he had assumed on first perceiving me, his body very much drawn back,
his left foot far in advance of his right, and with his right hand still
grasping the halter of the horse, which gave way more and more, till
it was clean down on its haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the voice which I had
last heard.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>&ldquo;Get
back with you, Belle, Moll,&rdquo; said the man, still staring at me:
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s something not over-canny or comfortable here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the same voice; &ldquo;let me pass,
Moll, and I&rsquo;ll soon clear the way,&rdquo; and I heard a kind of
rushing down the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid,&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to
the man,&mdash;&ldquo;I mean you no harm; I am a wanderer like yourself&mdash;-come
here to seek for shelter&mdash;you need not be afraid; I am a Rome chabo
<a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82">{82}</a> by matriculation&mdash;one
of the right sort, and no mistake.&nbsp; Good day to ye, brother; I
bids ye welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man eyed me suspiciously for a moment&mdash;then, turning to
his horse with a loud curse, he pulled him up from his haunches, and
led him and the cart farther down to one side of the dingle, muttering
as he passed me, &ldquo;Afraid?&nbsp; Hm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not remember ever to have seen a more ruffianly-looking fellow:
he was about six feet high, with an immensely athletic frame; his face
was black and bluff, and sported an immense pair of whiskers, but with
here and there a grey hair, for his age could not be much under fifty.&nbsp;
He wore a faded blue frock coat, corduroys, and highlows&mdash;on his
black head was a kind of red nightcap, round his bull neck a Barcelona
handkerchief&mdash;I did not like the look of the man at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid,&rdquo; growled the fellow, proceeding to unharness
his horse; &ldquo;that was the word, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But other figures were now already upon the scene.&nbsp; Dashing
past the other horse and cart, which by this <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>time
had reached the bottom of the pass, appeared an exceedingly tall woman,
or rather girl, for she could scarcely have been above eighteen; she
was dressed in a tight bodice, and a blue stuff gown; hat, bonnet or
cap she had none, and her hair, which was flaxen, hung down on her shoulders
unconfined; her complexion was fair, and her features handsome, with
a determined but open expression.&nbsp; She was followed by another
female, about forty, stout and vulgar-looking, at whom I scarcely glanced,
my whole attention being absorbed by the tall girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jack?&rdquo; said the latter, looking
at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only afraid, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the man, still
proceeding with his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid at what?&mdash;at that lad?&nbsp; Why, he looks like
a ghost&mdash;I would engage to thrash him with one hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might beat me with no hands at all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;fair
damsel, only by looking at me: I never saw such a face and figure, both
regal&mdash;why, you look like Ingeborg, Queen of Norway; she had twelve
brothers, you know, and could lick them all, though they were heroes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On Dovrefeld in Norway,<br />
Were once together seen,<br />
The twelve heroic brothers<br />
Of Ingeborg the queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;None of your chaffing, young fellow,&rdquo; said the tall
girl, &ldquo;or I will give you what shall make you wipe your face;
be civil, or you will rue it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>&ldquo;Well,
perhaps I was a peg too high,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;I ask your pardon&mdash;here&rsquo;s
something a bit lower&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As I was jawing to the gav yeck divvus
<a name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a">{84a}</a><br />
I met on the drom miro Rommany chi&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b">{84b}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;None of your Rommany chies, young fellow,&rdquo; said the
tall girl, looking more menacingly than before, and clenching her fist;
&ldquo;you had better be civil.&nbsp; I am none of your chies; and,
though I keep company with gypsies or, to speak more proper, half and
halfs, I would have you to know that I come of Christian blood and parents,
and was born in the great house of Long Melford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that it was a great
house; judging from your size, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you were
born in a church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Belle,&rdquo; said the man, putting himself before the
young virago, who was about to rush upon me, &ldquo;my turn is first.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, advancing to me in a menacing attitude, he said with a look of
deep malignity, &ldquo;&lsquo;Afraid&rsquo; was the word, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I think I wronged you; I
should have said, aghast&mdash;you exhibited every symptom of one labouring
under uncontrollable fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow stared at me with a look of stupid ferocity, and appeared
to be hesitating whether to strike or not: ere he could make up his
mind, the tall girl stepped forward, crying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s chaffing;
let me at him!&rdquo; and, before I could put myself on my guard, <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>she
struck me a blow on the face which had nearly brought me to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said I, putting my hand to my cheek; &ldquo;you
have now performed your promise, and made me wipe my face: now be pacified,
and tell me fairly the ground of this quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grounds!&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you say
I was afraid? and if you hadn&rsquo;t, who gave you leave to camp on
my ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your ground?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty question,&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;as if all
the world didn&rsquo;t know that.&nbsp; Do you know who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;unless I am much mistaken,
you are he whom folks call the &lsquo;Flaming Tinman.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m glad we have met, for I wished to see
you.&nbsp; These are your two wives, I suppose; I greet them.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no harm done&mdash;there&rsquo;s room enough here for
all of us&mdash;we shall soon be good friends, I dare say; and when
we are a little better acquainted, I&rsquo;ll tell you my history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that doesn&rsquo;t beat all!&rdquo; said the fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s chaffing now,&rdquo; said the
girl, whose anger seemed to have subsided on a sudden; &ldquo;the young
man speaks civil enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Civil!&rdquo; said the fellow, with an oath; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s
just like you: with you it is a blow, and all over.&nbsp; Civil!&nbsp;
I suppose you would have him stay here, and get into all my secrets,
and hear all I may have to say to my two morts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>&ldquo;Two
morts,&rdquo; <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86">{86}</a>
said the girl, kindling up&mdash;&ldquo;where are they?&nbsp; Speak
for one, and no more.&nbsp; I am no mort of yours, whatever some one
else may be.&nbsp; I tell you one thing, Black John, or Anselo, for
t&rsquo;other an&rsquo;t your name, the same thing I told the young
man here, be civil, or you will rue it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow looked at the girl furiously, but his glance soon quailed
before hers; he withdrew his eyes, and cast them on my little horse,
which was feeding amongst the trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
said he, rushing forward and seizing the animal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, as
I am alive, this is the horse of that mumping villain Slingsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his no longer; I bought it and paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine now,&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;I swore
I would seize it the next time I found it on my beat&mdash;ay, and beat
the master too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not Slingsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s one for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say you will beat me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid was the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick and feeble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up your fists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the horse satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horse nor bellows either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mercy, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your eyes, Jack.&nbsp; There, you&rsquo;ve got it.&nbsp;
I thought so,&rdquo; shouted the girl, as the fellow staggered <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>back
from a sharp blow in the eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought he was chaffing
at you all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Anselo.&nbsp; You know what to do&mdash;go in,&rdquo;
said the vulgar woman, who had hitherto not spoken a word, but who now
came forward with all the look of a fury; &ldquo;go in, apopli; <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87">{87}</a>
you&rsquo;ll smash ten like he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Flaming Tinman took her advice, and came in bent on smashing,
but stopped short on receiving a left-handed blow on the nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never beat the Flaming Tinman in that way,&rdquo;
said the girl, looking at me doubtfully.</p>
<p>And so I began to think myself, when, in the twinkling of an eye,
the Flaming Tinman disengaged himself of his frock-coat, and, dashing
off his red nightcap, came rushing in more desperately than ever.&nbsp;
To a flush hit which he received in the mouth he paid as little attention
as a wild bull would have done; in a moment his arms were around me,
and in another, he had hurled me down, falling heavily upon me.&nbsp;
The fellow&rsquo;s strength appeared to be tremendous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay him off now,&rdquo; said the vulgar woman.&nbsp; The Flaming
Tinman made no reply, but planting his knee on my breast, seized my
throat with two huge horny hands.&nbsp; I gave myself up for dead, and
probably should have been so in another minute but for the tall girl,
who caught hold of the handkerchief which the fellow wore round his
neck with a grasp nearly as powerful as that with which he pressed my
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call that fair play?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>&ldquo;Hands
off, Belle,&rdquo; said the other woman; &ldquo;do you call it fair
play to interfere? hands off, or I&rsquo;ll be down upon you myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Belle paid no heed to the injunction, and tugged so hard at the
handkerchief, that the Flaming Tinman was nearly throttled; suddenly
relinquishing his hold of me, he started on his feet, and aimed a blow
at my fair preserver, who avoided it, but said coolly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish t&rsquo;other business first, and then I&rsquo;m your
woman whenever you like; but finish it fairly&mdash;no foul play when
I&rsquo;m by&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be the boy&rsquo;s second, and Moll can
pick you up when he happens to knock you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle during the next ten minutes raged with considerable fury,
but it so happened that during this time I was never able to knock the
Flaming Tinman down, but on the contrary received six knock-down blows
myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can never stand this,&rdquo; said I, as I sat
on the knee of Belle: &ldquo;I am afraid I must give in; the Flaming
Tinman hits very hard,&rdquo; and I spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough you&rsquo;ll never beat the Flaming Tinman in
the way you fight&mdash;it&rsquo;s of no use flipping at the Flaming
Tinman with your left hand: why don&rsquo;t you use your right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not handy with it,&rdquo; said I; and then
getting up, I once more confronted the Flaming Tinman, and struck him
six blows for his one, but they were all left-handed blows, and the
blow which the Flaming Tinman gave me knocked me off my legs.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>&ldquo;Now,
will you use Long Melford?&rdquo; said Belle, picking me up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by Long Melford,&rdquo; said
I, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this long right of yours,&rdquo; said Belle, feeling
my right arm&mdash;&ldquo;if you do, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you
yet stand a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the Flaming Tinman was once more ready, much more ready than
myself.&nbsp; I, however, rose from my second&rsquo;s knee as well as
my weakness would permit me; on he came striking left and right, appearing
almost as fresh as to wind and spirit as when he first commenced the
combat, though his eyes were considerably swelled, and his nether lip
was cut in two; on he came, striking left and right, and I did not like
his blows at all, or even the wind of them, which was anything but agreeable,
and I gave way before him.&nbsp; At last he aimed a blow which, had
it taken full effect, would doubtless have ended the battle, but, owing
to his slipping, the fist only grazed my left shoulder, and came with
terrific force against a tree, close to which I had been driven; before
the Tinman could recover himself, I collected all my strength, and struck
him beneath the ear, and then fell to the ground completely exhausted,
and it so happened that the blow which I struck the Tinker beneath the
ear was a right-handed blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Long Melford!&rdquo; I heard Belle exclaim; &ldquo;there
is nothing like Long Melford for shortness all the world over.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>At
these words, I turned round my head as I lay, and perceived the Flaming
Tinman stretched upon the ground apparently senseless.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
is dead,&rdquo; said the vulgar woman, as she vainly endeavoured to
raise him up; &ldquo;he is dead; the best man in all the north country,
killed in this fashion, by a boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alarmed at these words,
I made shift to get on my feet; and, with the assistance of the woman,
placed my fallen adversary in a sitting posture.&nbsp; I put my hand
to his heart, and felt a slight pulsation.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not
dead,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;only stunned; if he were let blood, he would
recover presently.&rdquo;&nbsp; I produced a penknife which I had in
my pocket, and, baring the arm of the Tinman, was about to make the
necessary incision, when the woman gave me a violent blow, and, pushing
me aside, exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tear the eyes out of your head,
if you offer to touch him.&nbsp; Do you want to complete your work,
and murder him outright, now he&rsquo;s asleep? you have had enough
of his blood already.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are mad,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I only seek to do him service.&nbsp; Well, if you won&rsquo;t
let him be blooded, fetch some water and fling it into his face; you
know where the pit is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty man&oelig;uvre,&rdquo; said the woman: &ldquo;leave
my mard <a name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a">{90a}</a> in
the hands of you and that limmer, <a name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b">{90b}</a>
who has never been true to us: I should find him strangled or his throat
cut when I came back.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you go,&rdquo; said I to
the tall girl, &ldquo;take the can and fetch some water from the pit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You had better go yourself,&rdquo; said the girl, wiping a tear
as she looked on the yet senseless <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>form
of the tinker; &ldquo;you had better go yourself, if you think water
will do him good.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had by this time somewhat recovered
my exhausted powers, and, taking the can, I bent my steps as fast as
I could to the pit; arriving there, I lay down on the brink, took a
long draught, and then plunged my head into the water; after which I
filled the can, and bent my way back to the dingle.&nbsp; Before I could
reach the path which led down into its depths, I had to pass some way
along its side; I had arrived at a part immediately over the scene of
the last encounter, where the bank, overgrown with trees, sloped precipitously
down.&nbsp; Here I heard a loud sound of voices in the dingle; I stopped,
and laying hold of a tree, leaned over the bank and listened.&nbsp;
The two women appeared to be in hot dispute in the dingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was all owing to you, you limmer,&rdquo; said the vulgar woman to the
other; &ldquo;had you not interfered, the old man would soon have settled
the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for fair play and Long Melford,&rdquo; said the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;If yow old man, as you call him, could have settled
the boy fairly, he might, for all I should have cared, but no foul work
for me; and as for sticking the boy with our gulleys <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91">{91}</a>
when he comes back, as you proposed, I am not so fond of your old man
or you that I should oblige you in it, to my soul&rsquo;s destruction.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, or I&rsquo;ll . . .&rdquo;; I listened no farther,
but hastened as fast as I could to the dingle.&nbsp; My adversary had
just begun to show signs of animation; <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the
vulgar woman was still supporting him, and occasionally cast glances
of anger at the tall girl, who was walking slowly up and down.&nbsp;
I lost no time in dashing the greater part of the water into the Tinman&rsquo;s
face, whereupon he sneezed, moved his hands, and presently looked round
him.&nbsp; At first his looks were dull and heavy, and without any intelligence
at all; he soon, however, began to recollect himself, and to be conscious
of his situation; he cast a scowling glance at me, then one of the deepest
malignity at the tall girl, who was still walking about without taking
much notice of what was going forward.&nbsp; At last he looked at his
right hand, which had evidently suffered from the blow against the tree,
and a half-stifled curse escaped his lips.&nbsp; The vulgar woman now
said something to him in a low tone, whereupon he looked at her for
a moment, and then got upon his legs.&nbsp; Again the vulgar woman said
something to him; her looks were furious, and she appeared to be urging
him on to attempt something.&nbsp; I observed that she had a clasped
knife in her hand.&nbsp; The fellow remained standing for some time,
as if hesitating what to do; at last he looked at his hand, and, shaking
his head, said something to the woman which I did not understand.&nbsp;
The tall girl, however, appeared to overhear him, and, probably repeating
his words, said, &ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t do: you are right there;
and now hear what I have to say,&mdash;let bygones be bygones, and let
us all shake hands, and camp here, as the young man was saying just
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man looked at her, and then, without any reply,
went to his <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>horse,
which was lying down among the trees, and kicking it up, led it to the
cart, to which he forthwith began to harness it.&nbsp; The other cart
and horse had remained standing motionless during the whole affair which
I have been recounting, at the bottom of the pass.&nbsp; The woman now
took the horse by the head, and leading it with the cart into the open
part of the dingle, turned both round, and then led them back, till
the horse and cart had mounted a little way up the ascent; she then
stood still and appeared to be expecting the man.&nbsp; During this
proceeding Belle had stood looking on without saying anything; at last,
perceiving that the man had harnessed his horse to the other cart, and
that both he and the woman were about to take their departure, she said,
&ldquo;You are not going, are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Receiving no answer,
she continued: &ldquo;I tell you what, both of you, Black John, and
you Moll, his mort, this is not treating me over civilly,&mdash;however,
I am ready to put up with it, and to go with you if you like, for I
bear no malice.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for what has happened, but you
have only yourselves to thank for it.&nbsp; Now, shall I go with you?
only tell me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man made no manner of reply, but flogged
his horse.&nbsp; The woman, however, whose passions were probably under
less control, replied, with a screeching tone, &ldquo;Stay where you
are, you jade, and may the curse of Judas cling to you,&mdash;stay with
the bit of a mullo <a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a">{93a}</a>
whom you helped, and my only hope is that he may gulley <a name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b">{93b}</a>
you before he comes to be&mdash;Have you with us, indeed! after what&rsquo;s
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>past,
no, nor nothing belonging to you.&nbsp; Fetch down your mailla <a name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a">{94a}</a>
go-cart and live here with your chabo.&rdquo; <a name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b">{94b}</a>&nbsp;
She then whipped on the horse, and ascended the pass, followed by the
man.&nbsp; The carts were light, and they were not long in ascending
the winding path.&nbsp; I followed, to see that they took their departure.&nbsp;
Arriving at the top, I found near the entrance a small donkey-cart,
which I concluded belonged to the girl.&nbsp; The tinker and his mort
were already at some distance; I stood looking after them for a little
time, then taking the donkey by the reins I led it with the cart to
the bottom of the dingle.&nbsp; Arrived there, I found Belle seated
on the stone by the fireplace.&nbsp; Her hair was all dishevelled, and
she was in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were bad people,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I did not
like them, but they were my only acquaintance in the wide world.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.&mdash;ISOPEL BERNERS: A TALL GIRL OF EIGHTEEN, AND
HER STORY.</h2>
<p>In the evening of that same day the tall girl and I sat at tea by
the fire, at the bottom of the dingle; the girl on a small stool, and
myself, as usual, upon my stone.</p>
<p>The water which served for the tea had been taken from a spring of
pellucid water in the neighbourhood, which I had not had the good fortune
to discover, though it was well known to my companion, and to the wandering
people who frequented the dingle.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>&ldquo;This
tea is very good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I cannot enjoy it as much
as if I were well: I feel very sadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else should you feel,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;after
fighting with the Flaming Tinman?&nbsp; All I wonder is that you can
feel at all!&nbsp; As for the tea, it ought to be good, seeing that
it cost me ten shillings a pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great deal for a person in your station to
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my station!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have you to know, young man&mdash;however,
I haven&rsquo;t the heart to quarrel with you, you look so ill; and
after all, it is a good sum to pay for one who travels the roads; but
if I must have tea, I like to have the best; and tea I must have, for
I am used to it, though I can&rsquo;t help thinking that it sometimes
fills my head with strange fancies&mdash;what some folks call vapours,
making me weep and cry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should never have thought
that one of your size and fierceness would weep and cry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My size and fierceness!&nbsp; I tell you what, young man,
you are not over civil, this evening; but you are ill, as I said before,
and I shan&rsquo;t take much notice of your language, at least for the
present; as for my size, I am not so much bigger than yourself; and
as for being fierce, you should be the last one to fling that at me.&nbsp;
It is well for you that I can be fierce sometimes.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t
taken your part against Blazing Bosville, you wouldn&rsquo;t be now
taking tea with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that you struck me in the face first; but we&rsquo;ll
let that pass.&nbsp; So that man&rsquo;s name is Bosville; what&rsquo;s
your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>&ldquo;Isopel
Berners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, young man, you seem fond of asking questions! will
you have another cup of tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to ask for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, here it is, and much good may it do you; as for
my name, I got it from my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s name, then, was Isopel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isopel Berners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But had you never a father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had a father,&rdquo; said the girl, sighing, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t bear his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the fashion, then, in your country for children to bear
their mother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask such questions, young man, I shall be angry with
you.&nbsp; I have told you my name, and whether my father&rsquo;s or
mother&rsquo;s, I am not ashamed of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a noble name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are right, young man.&nbsp; The chaplain in the
great house, where I was born, told me it was a noble name; it was odd
enough, he said, that the only three noble names in the country were
to be found in the great house; mine was one; the other two were Devereux
and Bohun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by the great house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that you were born there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, young man; and as you now speak softly and kindly, I
will tell you my whole tale.&nbsp; My father <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>was
an officer of the sea, and was killed at sea as he was coming home to
marry my mother, Isopel Berners.&nbsp; He had been acquainted with her,
and had left her; but after a few months he wrote her a letter, to say
that he had no rest, and that he repented, and that as soon as his ship
came to port he would do her all the reparation in his power.&nbsp;
Well, young man, the very day before they reached port they met the
enemy, and there was a fight, and my father was killed, after he had
struck down six of the enemy&rsquo;s crew on their own deck; for my
father was a big man, as I have heard, and knew tolerably well how to
use his hands.&nbsp; And when my mother heard the news, she became half
distracted, and ran away into the fields and forests, totally neglecting
her business, for she was a small milliner; and so she ran demented
about the meads and forests for a long time, now sitting under a tree,
and now by the side of a river&mdash;at last she flung herself into
some water, and would have been drowned, had not some one been at hand
and rescued her, whereupon she was conveyed to the great house, lest
she should attempt to do herself further mischief, for she had neither
friends nor parents&mdash;and there she died three months after, having
first brought me into the world.&nbsp; She was a sweet, pretty creature,
I&rsquo;m told, but hardly fit for this world, being neither large,
nor fierce, nor able to take her own part.&nbsp; So I was born and bred
in the great house, where I learnt to read and sew, to fear God, and
to take my own part.&nbsp; When I was fourteen I was put out to service
to a small farmer and his wife, with whom, <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>however,
I did not stay long, for I was half starved, and otherwise ill-treated,
especially by my mistress, who one day attempted to knock me down with
a besom, I knocked her down with my fist, and went back to the great
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did they receive you in the great house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very kindly, young man&mdash;on the contrary, I was put
into a dark room, where I was kept a fortnight on bread and water; I
did not much care, however, being glad to have got back to the great
house at any rate, the place where I was born, and where my poor mother
died; and in the great house I continued two years longer, reading and
sewing, fearing God, and taking my own part when necessary.&nbsp; At
the end of the two years I was again put out to service, but this time
to a rich farmer and his wife, with whom, however, I did not live long,&mdash;less
time, I believe, than with the poor ones, being obliged to leave for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knocking your mistress down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, young man, knocking my master down, who conducted himself
improperly towards me.&nbsp; This time I did not go back to the great
house, having a misgiving that they would not receive me; so I turned
my back to the great house where I was born, and where my poor mother
died, and wandered for several days, I know not whither, supporting
myself on a few halfpence, which I chanced to have in my pocket.&nbsp;
It happened one day, as I sat under a hedge crying, having spent my
last farthing, that a comfortable-looking elderly woman came up in a
cart, and seeing the state in which <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>I
was, she stopped and asked what was the matter with me.&nbsp; I told
her some part of my story, whereupon she said, &lsquo;Cheer up, my dear:
if you like, you shall go with me, and wait upon me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of
course I wanted little persuasion, so I got into the cart and went with
her.&nbsp; She took me to London and various other places, and I soon
found that she was a travelling woman, who went about the country with
silks and linen.&nbsp; I was of great use to her, more especially in
those places where we met evil company.&nbsp; Once, as we were coming
from Dover, we were met by two sailors, who stopped our cart, and would
have robbed and stripped us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me get down,&rsquo; said
I; so I got down, and fought with them both, till they turned round
and ran away.&nbsp; Two years I lived with the old gentlewoman, who
was very kind to me, almost as kind as a mother; at last she fell sick
at a place in Lincolnshire, and after a few days died, leaving me her
cart and stock in trade, praying me only to see her decently buried,
which I did, giving her a funeral fit for a gentlewoman.&nbsp; After
which I travelled the country melancholy enough for want of company,
but so far fortunate, that I could take my own part when anybody was
uncivil to me.&nbsp; At last, passing through the valley of Todmorden,
I formed the acquaintance of Blazing Bosville and his wife, with whom
I occasionally took journeys for company&rsquo;s sake, for it is melancholy
to travel about alone, even when one can take one&rsquo;s own part.&nbsp;
I soon found they were evil people; but, upon the whole, they treated
me civilly, and I sometimes lent them a little money, so <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>that
we got on tolerably well together.&nbsp; He and I, it is true, had once
a dispute, and nearly came to blows; for once, when we were alone, he
wanted me to marry him, promising, if I would, to turn off Grey Moll,
or if I liked it better, to make her wait upon me as a maid-servant.&nbsp;
I never liked him much, but from that hour less than ever.&nbsp; Of
the two, I believe Grey Moll to be the best, for she is at any rate
true and faithful to him, and I like truth and constancy, don&rsquo;t
you, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are very nice things.&nbsp;
I feel very strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid, at what?&nbsp; At the Flaming Tinman?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
be afraid of him.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t come back, and if he did, he
shouldn&rsquo;t touch you in this state: I&rsquo;d fight him for you.&nbsp;
But he won&rsquo;t come back, so you needn&rsquo;t be afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of the Flaming Tinman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil one?&rdquo; said the girl: &ldquo;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heed,&rdquo; said the girl: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand
by you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>CHAPTER
VI.&mdash;A FOAMING DRAUGHT&mdash;THE MAGIC OF ALE.</h2>
<p>The kitchen of the public-house was a large one, and many people
were drinking in it; there was a confused hubbub of voices.</p>
<p>I sat down on a bench behind a deal table, of which there were three
or four in the kitchen; presently a bulky man, in a green coat, of the
Newmarket cut, and without a hat, entered, and observing me, came up,
and in rather a gruff tone cried, &ldquo;Want anything, young fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a jug of ale,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if you are the
master, as I suppose you are, by that same coat of yours, and your having
no hat on your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be saucy, young fellow,&rdquo; said the landlord,
for such he was, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be saucy, or&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whatever he intended to say, he left unsaid, for fixing his eyes upon
one of my hands, which I had placed by chance upon the table, he became
suddenly still.</p>
<p>This was my left hand, which was raw and swollen, from the blows
dealt on a certain hard skull in a recent combat.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
do you mean by staring at my hand so?&rdquo; said I, withdrawing it
from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, young man, no offence,&rdquo; said the landlord
in a quite altered tone; &ldquo;but the sight of your hand&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then observing that our conversation began to attract the notice of
the guests in the kitchen, he interrupted himself saying in an undertone,
&ldquo;But <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>mum&rsquo;s
the word for the present; I will go and fetch the ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In about a minute he returned, with a jug of ale foaming high.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your health,&rdquo; said he, blowing off the foam
and drinking; but perceiving that I looked rather dissatisfied, he murmured,
&ldquo;All&rsquo;s right&mdash;I glory in you; but mum&rsquo;s the word.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then placing the jug on the table, he gave me a confidential nod, and
swaggered out of the room.</p>
<p>What can the silly impertinent fellow mean? thought I; but the ale
was now before me, and I hastened to drink, for my weakness was great,
and my mind was full of dark thoughts, the remains of the indescribable
horror of the preceding night.&nbsp; It may kill me, thought I, as I
drank deep; but who cares? anything is better than what I have suffered.&nbsp;
I drank deep, and then leaned back against the wall; it appeared as
if a vapour was stealing up into my brain, gentle and benign, soothing
and stilling the horror and the fear; higher and higher it mounted,
and I felt nearly overcome; but the sensation was delicious, compared
with that I had lately experienced, and now I felt myself nodding; and,
bending down, I laid my head on the table on my folded hands.</p>
<p>And in that attitude I remained some time, perfectly unconscious.&nbsp;
At length, by degrees, perception returned, and I lifted up my head.&nbsp;
I felt somewhat dizzy and bewildered, but the dark shadow had withdrawn
itself from me.&nbsp; And now, once more, I drank of the jug; this second
draught did not produce an overpowering <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>effect
upon me&mdash;it revived and strengthened me&mdash;I felt a new man.</p>
<p>I looked around me: the kitchen had been deserted by the greater
part of the guests; besides myself, only four remained; these were seated
at the farther end.&nbsp; One was haranguing fiercely and eagerly; he
was abusing England, and praising America.&nbsp; At last he exclaimed,
&ldquo;So when I gets to New York, I will toss up my hat, and damn the
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That man must be a radical, thought I.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;A DISCIPLE OF WILLIAM COBBETT&mdash;THE SCHOLAR
ENCOUNTERS THE PRIEST.</h2>
<p>The individual whom I supposed to be a radical, after a short pause,
again uplifted his voice; he was rather a strong-built fellow of about
thirty, with an ill-favoured countenance, a white hat on his head, a
snuff-coloured coat on his back, and, when he was not speaking, a pipe
in his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who would live in such a country as England?&rdquo;
he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no country like America,&rdquo; said his nearest
neighbour, a man also in a white hat, and of a very ill-favoured countenance,&mdash;&ldquo;there
is no country like America,&rdquo; said he, withdrawing a pipe from
his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I shall&rdquo;&mdash;and here he took
a draught from a jug, the contents of which he appeared to have in common
with the other&mdash;&ldquo;go to America one of these days myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>&ldquo;Poor
old England is not such a bad country, after all,&rdquo; said a third,
a simple-looking man in a labouring dress, who sat smoking a pipe without
anything before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there was but a little more work
to be got I should have nothing to say against her.&nbsp; I hope, however&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hope? who cares what you hope?&rdquo; interrupted the
first, in a savage tone; &ldquo;you are one of those sneaking hounds
who are satisfied with dog&rsquo;s wages, a bit of bread and a kick.&nbsp;
Work, indeed! who, with the spirit of a man, would work for a country
where there is neither liberty of speech nor of action, a land full
of beggarly aristocracy, hungry borough-mongers, insolent parsons, and
&lsquo;their --- wives and daughters,&rsquo; as William Cobbett says,
in his &lsquo;Register&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the Church of England has been a source of incalculable
mischief to these realms,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>The person who uttered these words sat rather aloof from the rest;
he was dressed in a long black surtout.&nbsp; I could not see much of
his face, partly owing to his keeping it very much directed to the ground,
and partly owing to a large slouched hat which he wore; I observed,
however, that his hair was of a reddish tinge.&nbsp; On the table near
him was a glass and spoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said the first, alluding to what
this last had said: &ldquo;the Church of England has done incalculable
mischief here.&nbsp; I value no religion three halfpence, for I believe
in none; but the one that I hate most is the Church of England; so when
I get to New York, after I have shown the fine fellows <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>on
the quay a spice of me, by --- the King, I&rsquo;ll toss up my hat again,
and --- the Church of England too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose the people of New York should clap you in the
stocks?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>These words drew upon me the attention of the whole four.&nbsp; The
radical and his companion stared at me ferociously; the man in black
gave me a peculiar glance from under his slouched hat; the simple-looking
man in the labouring dress laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at, you fool?&rdquo; said the radical,
turning and looking at the other, who appeared to be afraid of him,
&ldquo;hold your noise; and a pretty fellow, you,&rdquo; said he, looking
at me, &ldquo;to come here, and speak against the great American nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak against the great American nation?&rdquo; said I:
&ldquo;I rather paid them a compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By supposing they would put me in the stocks?&nbsp; Well,
I call it abusing them, to suppose they would do any such thing.&nbsp;
Stocks, indeed!&mdash;there are no stocks in all the land.&nbsp; Put
me in the stocks? why, the President will come down to the quay, and
ask me to dinner, as soon as he hears what I have said about the King
and the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you go
to America, you will say of the President and country what now you say
of the King and Church, and cry out for somebody to sent you back to
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The radical dashed his pipe to pieces against the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
tell you what, young fellow, you are a spy of the aristocracy, sent
here to kick up a disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>&ldquo;Kicking
up a disturbance,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is rather inconsistent with
the office of spy.&nbsp; If I were a spy, I should hold my head down,
and say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black <a name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106">{106}</a>
partially raised his head, and gave me another peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sent to spy, you are sent
to bully, to prevent people speaking, and to run down the great American
nation; but you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t bully me.&nbsp; I say, down with
the aristocracy, the beggarly aristocracy!&nbsp; Come, what have you
to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; repeated the radical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;down with them as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can!&nbsp; I wish I could.&nbsp; But I can down
with a bully of theirs.&nbsp; Come, will you fight for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;though from what I have seen of them I should say they
are tolerably able to fight for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t fight for them,&rdquo; said the radical, triumphantly;
&ldquo;I thought so; all bullies, especially those of the aristocracy,
are cowards.&nbsp; Here, landlord,&rdquo; said he, raising his voice,
and striking against the table with the jug, &ldquo;some more ale&mdash;he
won&rsquo;t fight for his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A white feather,&rdquo; said his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landlord, landlord,&rdquo; shouted the radical, striking the
table with the jug louder than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who called?&rdquo; said the landlord, coming in at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fill this jug again,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and be
quick about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does any one else want anything?&rdquo; said the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;you may bring me
another glass of gin and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold?&rdquo; said the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;with a lump of sugar
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gin and water cold, with a lump of sugar in it,&rdquo; <a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107">{107}</a>
said I, and struck the table with my fist.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>&ldquo;Take
some?&rdquo; said the landlord inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;only something came into my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said the radical.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only
shamming; he knows his master is here, and therefore has recourse to
these man&oelig;uvres, but it won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Come, landlord,
what are you staring at?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you obey your orders?&nbsp;
Keeping your customers waiting in this manner is not the way to increase
your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord looked at the radical, and then at me.&nbsp; At last
taking the jug and glass, he left the apartment, and presently returned
with each filled with its respective liquor.&nbsp; He placed the jug
with the beer before the radical, and the glass with the gin and water
before the man in black, and then, with a wink to me, he sauntered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your health, sir,&rdquo; said the man of the snuff-coloured
coat, addressing himself to the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;I honour
you for what you said about the Church of England.&nbsp; Every one who
speaks against the Church of England has my warm heart.&nbsp; Down with
it, I say, and may the stones of it be used for mending the roads, as
my friend William says in his Register.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black, with a courteous nod of his head, drank to the
man in the snuff-coloured coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;With respect to the steeples,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I am not altogether of your opinion: they might be turned
to better account than to serve to mend the roads; they might still
be used as places of worship, but not for the worship of the Church
of England.&nbsp; I have no fault to find with <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the
steeples, it is the Church itself which I am compelled to arraign; but
it will not stand long, the respectable part of its ministers are already
leaving it.&nbsp; It is a bad Church, a persecuting Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom does it persecute?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; The man in black
glanced at me slightly, and then replied slowly, &ldquo;The Catholics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do those whom you call Catholics never persecute?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever read &lsquo;Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs?&rsquo;&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black, &ldquo;there is
not a word of truth in &lsquo;Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten times more than in the &lsquo;Flos Sanctorum,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>The man in black looked at me, but made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what say you to the Massacre of the Albigenses and the
Vaudois, &lsquo;whose bones lie scattered on the cold Alp,&rsquo; or
the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is because the Church of England
is not a persecuting Church, that those whom you call the respectable
part are leaving her; it is because they can&rsquo;t do with the poor
Dissenters what Simon de Montfort did with the Albigenses, and the cruel
Piedmontese with the Vaudois, that they turn to bloody Rome; the Pope
will no doubt welcome them, for the Pope, do you see, being very much
in want, will welcome&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo; said the radical, interfering, &ldquo;what are
<!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>you
saying about the Pope?&nbsp; I say hurrah for the Pope: I value no religion
three halfpence, as I said before, but if I were to adopt any, it should
be the Popish, as it&rsquo;s called, because I conceive the Popish to
be the grand enemy of the Church of England, of the beggarly aristocracy,
and the borough-monger system, so I won&rsquo;t hear the Pope abused
while I am by.&nbsp; Come, don&rsquo;t look fierce.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t
fight, you know, I have proved it; but I will give you another chance:
I will fight for the Pope&mdash;will you fight against him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear me, yes,&rdquo; said I, getting up and stepping forward.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am a quiet, peaceable young man, and, being so, am always ready
to fight against the Pope&mdash;the enemy of all peace and quiet&mdash;to
refuse fighting for the aristocracy is a widely different thing from
refusing to fight against the Pope&mdash;so come on, if you are disposed
to fight for him.&nbsp; To the Pope broken bells, to Saint James broken
shells.&nbsp; No Popish vile oppression, but the Protestant succession.&nbsp;
Confusion to the Groyne, hurrah for the Boyne, for the army at Clonmel,
and the Protestant young gentlemen who live there as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Orangeman,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a Platitude,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The man in black gave a slight start. <a name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110">{110}</a></p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>&ldquo;Amongst
that family,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no doubt something may be done, but
amongst the Methodist preachers I should conceive that the success would
not be great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black sat quite still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially amongst those who have wives,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>The man in black stretched his hand towards his gin and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we shall see what the grand
movement will bring about, and the results of the lessons in elocution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black lifted the glass up to his mouth, and in doing so,
let the spoon fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has this to do with the main question?&rdquo; said
I: &ldquo;I am waiting here to fight against the Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Hunter,&rdquo; said the companion of the man in the
snuff-coloured coat, &ldquo;get up, and fight for the Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the young fellow,&rdquo; said the man
in the snuff-coloured coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;so get
up, and serve him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>&ldquo;I
could serve out three like him,&rdquo; said the man in the snuff-coloured
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better for you,&rdquo; said the other&mdash;&ldquo;the
present work will be all the easier for you; get up, and serve him out
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the snuff-coloured coat did not stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shows the white feather now?&rdquo; said the simple-looking
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you to interfere?&rdquo; said the radical, turning
ferociously towards the simple-looking man; &ldquo;say another word,
and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;And you!&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to
the man in black, &ldquo;a pretty fellow you to turn against me, after
I had taken your part.&nbsp; I tell you what, you may fight for yourself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll see you and your Pope in the pit of Eldon before I fight
for either of you, so make the most of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t fight?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the Pope,&rdquo; said the radical; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see the Pope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not fight for the Pope, whose
religion you would turn to, if you were inclined for any?&nbsp; I see
how it is; you are not fond of fighting.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll give you
another chance.&nbsp; You were abusing the Church of England just now.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll fight for it&mdash;will you fight against it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Hunter,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;get up, and fight
against the Church of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no particular quarrel against the Church of England,&rdquo;
said the man in the snuff-coloured coat; &ldquo;my <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>quarrel
is with the aristocracy.&nbsp; If I said anything against the Church,
it is merely for a bit of corollary, as Master William Cobbett would
say; the quarrel with the Church belongs to this fellow in black, so
let him carry it on.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; he continued suddenly, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t slink from the matter either; it shall never be said by
the fine fellows on the quay of New York, that I wouldn&rsquo;t fight
against the Church of England.&nbsp; So down with the beggarly aristocracy,
the Church, and the Pope, to the bottom of the pit of Eldon, and may
the Pope fall first, and the others upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, dashing his hat on the table, he placed himself in an
attitude of offence, and rushed forward.&nbsp; He was, as I have said
before, a powerful fellow, and might have proved a dangerous antagonist,
more especially to myself, who, after my recent encounter with the Flaming
Tinman, and my wrestlings with the evil one, was in anything but fighting
order.&nbsp; Any collision, however, was prevented by the landlord,
who, suddenly appearing, thrust himself between us.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
shall be no fighting here,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;no one shall fight
in this house, except it be with myself; so if you two have anything
to say to each other, you had better go into the field behind the house.&nbsp;
But you fool,&rdquo; said he, pushing Hunter violently on the breast,
&ldquo;do you know whom you are going to tackle with?&mdash;this is
the young chap that beat Blazing Bosville, only as late as yesterday,
in Mumpers Dingle.&nbsp; Grey Moll told me all about it last night,
when she came for some brandy for her husband, who, she said, had been
half killed; and she <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>described
the young man to me so closely, that I knew him at once, that is, as
soon as I saw how his left hand was bruised, for she told me he was
a left-hand hitter.&nbsp; Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it all true, young man?&nbsp;
Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you he that beat Flaming Bosville in Mumpers Dingle?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never beat Flaming Bosville,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;he beat
himself.&nbsp; Had he not struck his hand against a tree, I shouldn&rsquo;t
be here at the present moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo;
said the landlord, &ldquo;now that&rsquo;s just as it should be; I like
a modest man, for, as the parson says, nothing sits better upon the
young man than modesty.&nbsp; I remember, when I was young, fighting
with Tom of Hopton, the best man that ever pulled off coat in England.&nbsp;
I remember, too, that I won the battle; for I happened to hit Tom of
Hopton in the mark, as he was coming in, so that he lost his wind, and
falling squelch on the ground, do ye see, he lost the battle; though
I am free to confess that he was a better man than myself&mdash;indeed,
the best man that ever fought in England.&nbsp; Yet still I won the
battle, as every customer of mine, and everybody within twelve miles
round, has heard over and over again.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Hunter, I have
one thing to say; if you choose to go into the field behind the house,
and fight the young man, you can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll back him for ten
pounds; but no fighting in my kitchen&mdash;because why?&nbsp; I keeps
a decent kind of an establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to fight the young man,&rdquo; said Hunter;
&ldquo;more especially as he has nothing to say for the aristocracy.&nbsp;
If he chose to fight for them, indeed&mdash;but he won&rsquo;t, I know;
for I see he&rsquo;s a decent, <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>respectable
young man; and, after all, fighting is a blackguard way of settling
a dispute, so I have no wish to fight.&nbsp; However, there is one thing
I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said he, uplifting his fist; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
fight this fellow in black here for half a crown, or for nothing, if
he pleases; it was he that got up the last dispute between me and the
young man, with his Pope and his nonsense; so I will fight him for anything
he pleases, and perhaps the young man will be my second; whilst you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Doctor,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;or whatsoever
you be, will you go into the field with Hunter?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll second
you, only you must back yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lay five pounds on
Hunter, if you are inclined to back yourself; and will help you to win
it as far, do you see, as a second can; because why?&nbsp; I always
likes to do the fair thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I have no wish to fight,&rdquo; said the man in
black, hastily; &ldquo;fighting is not my trade.&nbsp; If I have given
any offence, I beg anybody&rsquo;s pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what have I to pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;glad to see
you.&nbsp; This is the first time that you have been at my house, and
I never charge new customers, at least customers such as you, anything
for the first draught.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll come again, I daresay; shall
always be glad to see you.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; said
he, as I put sixpence on the table; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but not in payment for
anything I have had myself: it shall serve to pay for a jug of ale for
that gentleman,&rdquo; said I, pointing to the <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>simple-looking
individual; &ldquo;he is smoking a poor pipe, I do not mean to say that
a pipe is a bad thing; but a pipe without ale, do you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just
the conduct I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Hunter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall be happy to
drink with the young man whenever I meet him at New York, where, do
you see, things are better managed than here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have given offence to anybody,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;I repeat that I ask pardon,&mdash;more especially to the
young gentleman, who was perfectly right to stand up for his religion,
just as I&mdash;not that I am of any particular religion, no more than
this honest gentleman here,&rdquo; bowing to Hunter; &ldquo;but I happen
to know something of the Catholics&mdash;several excellent friends of
mine are Catholics&mdash;and of a surety the Catholic religion is an
ancient religion, and a widely-extended religion, though it certainly
is not a universal religion, but it has of late made considerable progress,
even amongst those nations who have been particularly opposed to it&mdash;amongst
the Prussians and the Dutch, for example, to say nothing of the English;
and then, in the East, amongst the Persians, amongst the Armenians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Armenians,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;O dear me, the Armenians&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to say about those people, sir?&rdquo; said
the man in black, lifting up his glass to his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing further to say,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than
that <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>the
roots of Ararat are occasionally found to be deeper than those of Rome.&rdquo;
<a name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117">{117}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s half a crown broke,&rdquo; said the landlord,
as the man in black let fall the glass, which was broken to pieces on
the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will pay me the damage, friend, before you
leave this kitchen.&nbsp; I like to see people drink freely in my kitchen,
but not too freely, and I hate breakages: because why?&nbsp; I keeps
a decent kind of an establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>CHAPTER
VIII.&mdash;FIRST LESSONS IN ARMENIAN.</h2>
<p>The public-house where the scenes which I have attempted to describe
in the preceding chapters took place, was at the distance of about two
miles from the dingle.&nbsp; The sun was sinking in the west by the
time I returned to the latter spot.&nbsp; I found Belle seated by a
fire, over which her kettle was suspended.&nbsp; During my absence she
had prepared herself a kind of tent, consisting of large hoops covered
over with tarpaulin, quite impenetrable to rain, however violent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am glad you are returned,&rdquo; said she, as soon as she perceived
me; &ldquo;I began to be anxious about you.&nbsp; Did you take my advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I went to the public-house and
drank ale as you advised me; it cheered, strengthened, and drove away
the horror from my mind&mdash;I am much beholden to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would do you good,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I remembered
that when the poor women in the great house were afflicted with hysterics
and fearful imaginings, the surgeon, who was a good, kind man, used
to say, &lsquo;Ale, give them ale, and let it be strong.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was no advocate for tea, then?&rdquo; <a name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118">{118}</a>
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had no objection to tea; but he used to say, &lsquo;Everything
in its season.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shall we take ours now?&mdash;I have waited
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>&ldquo;I
have no objection,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I feel rather heated, and at
present should prefer tea to ale&mdash;&lsquo;Everything in its season,&rsquo;
as the surgeon said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Belle prepared tea, and, as we were taking it, she said,
&ldquo;What did you see and hear at the public-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you appear to have your full
portion of curiosity: what matters it to you what I saw and heard at
the public-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters very little to me,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I
merely inquired of you, for the sake of a little conversation.&nbsp;
You were silent, and it is uncomfortable for two people to sit together
without opening their lips&mdash;at least, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One only feels uncomfortable,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in being
silent, when one happens to be thinking of the individual with whom
one is in company.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I was not thinking of
my companion, but of certain company with whom I had been at the public-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, young man,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;you are not over
complimentary; but who may this wonderful company have been&mdash;some
young&mdash;?&rdquo; and here Belle stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there was no young person&mdash;if
person you were going to say.&nbsp; There was a big portly landlord,
whom I dare say you have seen; a noisy, savage radical, who wanted at
first to fasten upon me a quarrel about America, but who subsequently
drew in his horns; then there was a strange fellow, a prowling priest,
I <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>believe,
whom I have frequently heard of, who at first seemed disposed to side
with the radical against me, and afterwards with me against the radical.&nbsp;
There, you know my company, and what took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there no one else?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mighty curious,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, none
else, except a poor simple mechanic, and some common company, who soon
went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle looked at me for a moment, and then appeared to be lost in
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;America,&rdquo; said she musingly&mdash;&ldquo;America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of America?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that it is a mighty country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have heard my father
say that the Americans are first-rate marksmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard nothing about that,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;what
I heard was, that it is a great and goodly land, where people can walk
about without jostling, and where the industrious can always find bread;
I have frequently thought of going thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the radical in the public-house
will perhaps be glad of your company thither; he is as great an admirer
of America as yourself, though I believe on different grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go by myself,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;unless&mdash;unless
that should happen which is not likely.&nbsp; I am not fond of radicals
no more than I am of scoffers and mockers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that I am a scoffer and mocker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to say you are,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but
some <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>of
your words sound strangely like scoffing and mocking.&nbsp; I have now
one thing to beg, which is, that if you have anything to say against
America, you would speak it out boldly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I have to say against America?&nbsp; I never was
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people speak against America who never were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people speak in praise of America who never were there;
but with respect to myself, I have not spoken for or against America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you liked America you would speak in its praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the same rule, if I disliked America I should speak against
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak with you,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but
I see you dislike the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the people&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you dislike them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I have heard my father say that the American marksmen,
led on by a chap of the name of Washington, sent the English to the
right-about in double-quick time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is your reason for disliking the Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is my reason for disliking
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take another cup of tea?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>I took another cup; we were again silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is rather
uncomfortable,&rdquo; said I, at last, &ldquo;for people to sit together
without having anything to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you thinking of your company?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>&ldquo;What
company?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present company!&nbsp; Oh, ah!&mdash;I remember that I
said one only feels uncomfortable in being silent with a companion,
when one happens to be thinking of the companion.&nbsp; Well, I had
been thinking of you the last two or three minutes, and had just come
to the conclusion, that to prevent us both feeling occasionally uncomfortably
towards each other, having nothing to say, it would be as well to have
a standing subject, on which to employ our tongues.&nbsp; Belle, I have
determined to give you lessons in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Armenian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of Ararat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the place where the ark rested; I have heard
the chaplain in the great house talk of it; besides, I have read of
it in the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Armenian is the speech of people of that place, and
I should like to teach it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To prevent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, to prevent our occasionally feeling uncomfortable
together.&nbsp; Your acquiring it besides might prove of ulterior advantage
to us both: for example, suppose you and I were in promiscuous company,
at Court, for example, and you had something to communicate to me which
you did not wish any one else to be acquainted with, how safely you
might communicate it to me in Armenian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would not the language of the roads do as well?&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>&ldquo;In
some places it would,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but not at Court, owing
to its resemblance to thieves&rsquo; slang.&nbsp; There is Hebrew, again,
which I was thinking of teaching you, till the idea of being presented
at Court made me abandon it, from the probability of our being understood,
in the event of our speaking it, by at least half a dozen people in
our vicinity.&nbsp; There is Latin, it is true, or Greek, which we might
speak aloud at Court with perfect confidence of safety; but upon the
whole I should prefer teaching you Armenian, not because it would be
a safer language to hold communication with at Court, but because, not
being very well grounded in it myself, I am apprehensive that its words
and forms may escape from my recollection, unless I have sometimes occasion
to call them forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we shall have to part company before I have learnt
it,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;in the mean time, if I wish to say anything
to you in private, somebody being by, shall I speak in the language
of the roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If no roadster is nigh, you may,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
I will do my best to understand you.&nbsp; Belle, I will now give you
a lesson in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean no harm,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least; I merely propose the thing to prevent our
occasionally feeling uncomfortable together.&nbsp; Let us begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop till I have removed the tea-things,&rdquo; said Belle;
and, getting up, she removed them to her own encampment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Belle, returning, and taking her <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>former
seat, &ldquo;to join with you in anything which will serve to pass away
the time agreeably, provided there is no harm in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have determined to commence
the course of Armenian lessons by teaching you the numerals; but, before
I do that, it will be as well to tell you that the Armenian language
is called Haik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that word will hang upon my memory,&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why hang upon it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the old women in the great house used to call so the
chimney-hook, on which they hung the kettle; in like manner, on the
hake of my memory I will hang your hake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will make an apt scholar;
but, mind, that I did not say hake, but haik; the words are, however,
very much alike; and, as you observe, upon your hake you may hang my
haik.&nbsp; We will now proceed to the numerals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are numerals?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Numbers.&nbsp; I will say the Haikan numbers up to ten.&nbsp;
There, have you heard them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, try and repeat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only remember number one,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and
that because it is me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will repeat them again,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and pay great
attention.&nbsp; Now, try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, jergo, earache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither said jergo, nor earache.&nbsp; I said yergou and
<!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>yerek.&nbsp;
Belle, I am afraid I shall have some difficulty with you as a scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle made no answer.&nbsp; Her eyes were turned in the direction
of the winding path, which led from the bottom of the hollow where we
were seated, to the plain above &ldquo;Gorgio shunella,&rdquo; <a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a">{125a}</a>
she said, at length, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure Rommany,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where?&rdquo; I added,
in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dovey odoy,&rdquo; <a name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b">{125b}</a>
said Belle, nodding with her head towards the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will soon see who it is,&rdquo; said I; and starting up,
I rushed towards the pathway, intending to lay violent hands on any
one I might find lurking in its windings.&nbsp; Before, however, I had
reached its commencement, a man, somewhat above the middle height, advanced
from it into the dingle, in whom I recognised the man in black, whom
I had seen in the public-house.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;LAVENGRO RECEIVES A VISIT OF CEREMONY FROM
THE MAN IN BLACK.</h2>
<p>The man in black and myself stood opposite to each other for a minute
or two in silence; I will not say that we confronted each other that
time, for the man in black, after a furtive glance, did not look me
in the face, but kept his eyes fixed, apparently on the leaves of a
bunch of ground nuts which were growing at my feet.&nbsp; <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>At
length, looking round the dingle, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Buona Sera, I
hope I don&rsquo;t intrude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have as much right here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as I or
my companion; but you had no right to stand listening to our conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not listening,&rdquo; said the man: &ldquo;I was hesitating
whether to advance or retire; and if I heard some of your conversation
the fault was not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see why you should have hesitated if your intentions
were good,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the kind of place in which I found myself might excuse
some hesitation,&rdquo; said the man in black, looking around; &ldquo;moreover,
from what I have seen of your demeanour at the public-house, I was rather
apprehensive that the reception I might experience at your hands might
be more rough than agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may have been your motive for coming to this place?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Per far visita &agrave; sua signoria, ecco il motivo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you speak to me in that gibberish,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;do
you think I understand it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not Armenian,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but
it might serve in a place like this, for the breathing of a little secret
communication, were any common roadster near at hand.&nbsp; It would
not do at Court, it is true, being the language of singing women, and
the like; but we are not at Court&mdash;when we are, I can perhaps summon
up a little indifferent Latin, if I have anything private to communicate
to the learned Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the conclusion of this speech the man in <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>black
lifted up his head, and, for some moments, looked me in the face.&nbsp;
The muscles of his own seemed to be slightly convulsed, and his mouth
opened in a singular manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that for some time you were standing
near me and my companion, in the mean act of listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the man in black: &ldquo;I heard from
the steep bank above, that to which I have now alluded, whilst I was
puzzling myself to find the path which leads to your retreat.&nbsp;
I made, indeed, nearly the compass of the whole thicket before I found
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you know that I was here?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landlord of the public-house, with whom I had some conversation
concerning you, informed me that he had no doubt I should find you in
this place, to which he gave me instructions not very clear.&nbsp; But
now I am here, I crave permission to remain a little time, in order
that I may hold some communion with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;since you are come, you are welcome;
please step this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I conducted the man in black to the fireplace, where Belle
was standing, who had risen from her stool on my springing up to go
in quest of the stranger.&nbsp; The man in black looked at her with
evident curiosity, then making her rather a graceful bow, &ldquo;Lovely
virgin,&rdquo; said he, stretching out his hand, &ldquo;allow me to
salute your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>&ldquo;I
am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not presume to request to shake hands with you,&rdquo;
said the man in black; &ldquo;I merely wished to be permitted to salute
with my lips the extremity of your two forefingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never permit anything of the kind,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I
do not approve of such unmanly ways: they are only befitting those who
lurk in corners or behind trees, listening to the conversation of people
who would fain be private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for a listener, then?&rdquo; said the man in
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, indeed I do,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;the young man may
receive your excuses, and put confidence in them if he please, but for
my part I neither admit them, nor believe them;&rdquo; and thereupon
flinging her long hair back, which was hanging over her cheeks, she
seated herself on her stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have bidden the gentleman
welcome; I beseech you, therefore, to make him welcome.&nbsp; He is
a stranger, where we are at home; therefore, even did we wish him away,
we are bound to treat him kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not English doctrine,&rdquo; said the man in
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the English prided themselves on their hospitality,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do so,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;they are
proud of showing hospitality to people above them, <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>that
is to those who do not want it, but of the hospitality which you were
now describing, and which is Arabian, they know nothing.&nbsp; No Englishman
will tolerate another in his house, from whom he does not expect advantage
of some kind, and to those from whom he does, he can be civil enough.&nbsp;
An Englishman thinks that, because he is in his own house, he has a
right to be boorish and brutal to any one who is disagreeable to him,
as all those are who are really in want of assistance.&nbsp; Should
a hunted fugitive rush into an Englishman&rsquo;s house, beseeching
protection, and appealing to the master&rsquo;s feelings of hospitality,
the Englishman would knock him down in the passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too general,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in your strictures;
Lord [Aberdeen], the unpopular Tory minister, was once chased through
the streets of London by a mob, and, being in danger of his life, took
shelter in the shop of a Whig linendraper, declaring his own unpopular
name, and appealing to the linendraper&rsquo;s feelings of hospitality;
whereupon the linendraper, utterly forgetful of all party rancour, nobly
responded to the appeal, and telling his wife to conduct his lordship
upstairs, jumped over the counter, with his ell in his hand, and placing
himself with half a dozen of his assistants at the door of his boutique,
manfully confronted the mob, telling them that he would allow himself
to be torn to a thousand pieces, ere he would permit them to injure
a hair of his lordship&rsquo;s head: what do you think of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I am afraid your own practice is not very different from
that which you have been just now describing: you sided with the radical
in the public-house against me, as long as you thought him the most
powerful, and then turned against him when you saw he was cowed.&nbsp;
What have you to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! when one is in Rome, I mean England, one must do as they
do in England; I was merely conforming to the custom of the country,
he! he! but I beg your pardon here, as I did in the public-house I made
a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we will drop the matter; but pray
seat yourself on that stone, and I will sit down on the grass near you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black, after proffering two or three excuses for occupying
what he supposed to be my seat, sat down upon the stone, and I squatted
down gypsy fashion, just opposite to him, Belle sitting on her stool
at a slight distance on my right.</p>
<p>After a time I addressed him thus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am I to reckon this
a mere visit of ceremony?&nbsp; Should it prove so, it will be, I believe,
the first visit of the kind ever paid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you permit me to ask,&rdquo; said the man in black,&mdash;&ldquo;the
weather is very warm,&rdquo; said he, interrupting himself, and taking
off his hat.</p>
<p>I now observed that he was partly bald, his red hair having died
away from the fore part of his crown; his forehead was high, his eyebrows
scanty, his eyes, <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>grey
and sly, with a downward tendency, his nose was slightly aquiline, his
mouth rather large&mdash;a kind of sneering smile played continually
on his lips, his complexion was somewhat rubicund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad countenance,&rdquo; said Belle, in the language of the
roads, observing that my eyes were fixed on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does not my countenance please you, fair damsel?&rdquo; said
the man in black, resuming his hat and speaking in a peculiarly gentle
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you understand the language
of the roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As little as I do Armenian,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;but I understand look and tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, perhaps,&rdquo; retorted Belle; &ldquo;and, to tell
you the truth, I like your tone as little as your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have you forgot what I was
saying just now about the duties of hospitality?&nbsp; You have not
yet answered my question,&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to the man,
&ldquo;with respect to your visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you permit me to ask who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the place where I live?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the man in black, looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the name of this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told it was Mumpers&rsquo; or Gypsies&rsquo; Dingle,&rdquo;
said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and this forge and tent, what
do they look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the forge and tent of a wandering Zigan; I have seen
the like in Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;they belong to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, then, a Gypsy?&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you seem to have been acquainted with various individuals
with whom I have likewise had acquaintance; and you have even alluded
to matters, and even words, which have passed between me and them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how Gypsies live!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By hammering old iron, I believe, and telling fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s my forge, and yonder
is some iron, though not old, and by your own confession I am a soothsayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you come by your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you want me to reveal the secrets
of my trade, I have, of course, nothing further to say.&nbsp; Go to
the scarlet dyer, and ask him how he dyes cloth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why scarlet?&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it because Gypsies blush like scarlet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies never blush,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but Gypsies&rsquo;
cloaks are scarlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should almost take you for a Gypsy,&rdquo; said the man
in black, &ldquo;but for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for that same lesson in Armenian, and your general knowledge
of languages; as for your manners and appearance I will say nothing,&rdquo;
said the man in black, with a titter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should not a Gypsy possess a knowledge of languages?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>&ldquo;Because
the Gypsy race is perfectly illiterate,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;they are possessed, it is true, of a knavish acuteness, and are
particularly noted for giving subtle and evasive answers&mdash;and in
your answers, I confess, you remind me of them; but that one of the
race should acquire a learned language like the Armenian, and have a
general knowledge of literature, is a thing che io non credo afatto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;I should consider
you to be a philologist, who, for some purpose, has taken up a Gypsy
life; but I confess to you that your way of answering questions is far
too acute for a philologist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should not a philologist be able to answer questions
acutely?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the philological race is the most stupid under Heaven,&rdquo;
said the man in black; &ldquo;they are possessed, it is true, of a certain
faculty for picking up words, and a memory for retaining them; but that
any one of the sect should be able to give a rational answer, to say
nothing of an acute one, on any subject&mdash;even though the subject
were philology&mdash;is a thing of which I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you found me giving a lesson in Armenian to this handmaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I did,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you heard me give what you are disposed to call acute
answers to the questions you asked me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I did,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>&ldquo;And
would any one but a philologist think of giving a lesson in Armenian
to a handmaid in a dingle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, don&rsquo;t you see that it is possible for a
philologist to give not only a rational, but an acute answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely puzzled,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puzzled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really puzzled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man in black, rising, &ldquo;puzzled
or not, I will no longer trespass upon your and this young lady&rsquo;s
retirement; only allow me, before I go, to apologise for my intrusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apology is necessary,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;will you please
to take anything before you go?&nbsp; I think this young lady, at my
request, will contrive to make you a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea!&rdquo; said the man in black&mdash;&ldquo;he! he!&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t drink tea; I don&rsquo;t like it,&mdash;if, indeed, you
had&mdash;&rdquo; and here he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like gin and water, is there?&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;but I am sorry to say I have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gin and water,&rdquo; said the man in black&mdash;&ldquo;how
do you know that I am fond of gin and water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not see you drinking some at the public-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>&ldquo;You
did,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and I remember, that when
I called for some, you repeated my words.&nbsp; Permit me to ask, Is
gin and water an unusual drink in England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not usually drunk cold, and with a lump of sugar,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you know who I was by my calling for it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies have various ways of obtaining information,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all your knowledge,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;you
do not appear to have known that I was coming to visit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies do not pretend to know anything which relates to themselves,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;but I advise you, if you ever come again, to come openly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I your permission to come again?&rdquo; said the man
in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come when you please; this dingle is as free for you as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will visit you again,&rdquo; said the man in black&mdash;&ldquo;till
then addio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; said I, after the man in black had departed,
&ldquo;we did not treat that man very hospitably; he left us without
having eaten or drunk at our expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You offered him some tea,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;which,
as it is mine, I should have grudged him, for I like him not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our liking or disliking him had nothing to do with the matter;
he was our visitor, and ought not to have <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>been
permitted to depart dry; living as we do in this desert, we ought always
to be prepared to administer to the wants of our visitors.&nbsp; Belle,
do you know where to procure any good Hollands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have no &lsquo;buts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle, I expect that
with as little delay as possible you procure, at my expense, the best
Hollands you can find.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.&mdash;HOW ISOPEL BERNERS AND THE WORD-MASTER PASSED
THEIR TIME IN THE DINGLE.</h2>
<p>Time passed on, and Belle and I lived in the dingle; when I say lived,
the reader must not imagine that we were always there.&nbsp; She went
out upon her pursuits, and I went out where inclination led me; but
my excursions were very short ones, and hers occasionally occupied whole
days and nights.&nbsp; If I am asked how we passed the time when we
were together in the dingle, I would answer that we passed the time
very tolerably, all things considered; we conversed together, and when
tired of conversing I would sometimes give Belle a lesson in Armenian;
her progress was not particularly brilliant, but upon the whole satisfactory;
in about a fortnight she had hung up one hundred Haikan numerals upon
the hake of her memory.&nbsp; I found her conversation highly entertaining;
she had seen much of England and Wales, and had been acquainted with
some of the most remarkable <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>characters
who travelled the roads at that period; and let me be permitted to say
that many remarkable characters have travelled the roads of England,
of whom fame has never said a word.&nbsp; I loved to hear her anecdotes
of these people; some of whom I found had occasionally attempted to
lay violent hands either upon her person or effects, and had invariably
been humbled by her without the assistance of either justice or constable.&nbsp;
I could clearly see, however, that she was rather tired of England,
and wished for a change of scene; she was particularly fond of talking
of America, to which country her aspirations chiefly tended.&nbsp; She
had heard much of America, which had excited her imagination; for at
that time America was much talked of, on roads and in homesteads, at
least so said Belle, who had good opportunities of knowing, and most
people allowed that it was a good country for adventurous English.&nbsp;
The people who chiefly spoke against it, as she informed me, were soldiers
disbanded upon pensions, the sextons of village churches, and excisemen.&nbsp;
Belle had a craving desire to visit that country, and to wander with
cart and little animal amongst its forests; when I would occasionally
object, that she would be exposed to danger from strange and perverse
customers, she said that she had not wandered the roads of England so
long and alone, to be afraid of anything which might befal in America;
and that she hoped with God&rsquo;s favour, to be able to take her own
part, and to give to perverse customers as good as they might bring.&nbsp;
She had a dauntless <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>heart
that same Belle: such was the staple of Belle&rsquo;s conversation.&nbsp;
As for mine, I would endeavour to entertain her with strange dreams
of adventure, in which I figured in opaque forests, strangling wild
beasts, or discovering and plundering the hoards of dragons; and sometimes
I would narrate to her other things far more genuine&mdash;how I had
tamed savage mares, wrestled with Satan, and had dealings with ferocious
publishers.&nbsp; Belle had a kind heart, and would weep at the accounts
I gave her of my early wrestlings with the dark Monarch.&nbsp; She would
sigh, too, as I recounted the many slights and degradations I had received
at the hands of ferocious publishers.&nbsp; But she had the curiosity
of a woman; and once, when I talked to her of the triumphs which I had
achieved over unbroken mares, she lifted up her head and questioned
me as to the secret of the virtue which I possessed over the aforesaid
animals: whereupon I sternly reprimanded, and forthwith commanded her
to repeat the Armenian numerals; and, on her demurring, I made use of
words, to escape which she was glad to comply, saying the Armenian numerals
from one to a hundred, which numerals, as a punishment for her curiosity,
I made her repeat three times, loading her with the bitterest reproaches
whenever she committed the slightest error, either in accent or pronunciation,
which reproaches she appeared to bear with the greatest patience.&nbsp;
And now I have given a fair account of the manner in which Isopel Berners
and myself passed our time in the dingle.</p>

XI.&mdash;ALE, GIVE THEM ALE, AND LET IT BE STRONG&mdash;A MAIN OF COCKS&mdash;LAVENGRO
CONSOLES THE LANDLORD, WHO PROPOUNDS A NOVEL PLAN FOR THE LIQUIDATION
OF DEBTS.</h2>
<p>Amongst other excursions, I went several times to the public-house,
to which I introduced the reader in a former chapter.&nbsp; I had experienced
such beneficial effects from the ale I had drunk on that occasion, that
I had wished to put its virtue to a frequent test; nor did the ale on
subsequent trials belie the good opinion which I had at first formed
of it.&nbsp; After each visit which I made to the public-house, I found
my frame stronger and my mind more cheerful than they had previously
been.&nbsp; The landlord appeared at all times glad to see me, and insisted
that I should sit within the bar, where, leaving his other guests to
be attended to by a niece of his who officiated as his housekeeper,
he would sit beside me and talk of matters concerning &ldquo;the ring,&rdquo;
indulging himself with a cigar and a glass of sherry, which he told
me was his favourite wine, whilst I drank my ale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I loves
the conversation of all you coves of the ring,&rdquo; said he once,
&ldquo;which is natural, seeing as how I have fought in a ring myself.&nbsp;
Ah, there is nothing like the ring; I wish I was not rather too old
to go again into it.&nbsp; I often think I should like to have another
rally&mdash;one more rally, and then&mdash;But there&rsquo;s a time
for all things&mdash;youth will be <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>served,
every dog has his day, and mine has been a fine one&mdash;let me be
content.&nbsp; After beating Tom of Hopton, there was not much more
to be done in the way of reputation; I have long sat in my bar the wonder
and glory of this here neighbourhood.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m content, as far
as reputation goes; I only wish money would come in a little faster;
however, the next main of cocks will bring me in something handsome&mdash;comes
off next Wednesday at --- have ventured ten five-pound notes&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t
say ventured either&mdash;run no risk at all, because why? I knows my
birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; About ten days after this harangue, I called again,
at about three o&rsquo;clock one afternoon.&nbsp; The landlord was seated
on a bench by a table in the common room, which was entirely empty;
he was neither smoking nor drinking, but sat with his arms folded, and
his head hanging down over his breast.&nbsp; At the sound of my step
he looked up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am glad you
are come: I was just thinking about you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;it was very kind of you, especially at a time like this,
when your mind must be full of your good fortune.&nbsp; Allow me to
congratulate you on the sums of money you won by the main of cocks at
---.&nbsp; I hope you brought it all safe home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Safe
home,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;I brought myself safe home, and
that was all; came home without a shilling, regularly done, cleaned
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
after you had won the money, you ought to have been satisfied, and not
risked it again.&nbsp; How did you lose it?&nbsp; I hope not by the
pea and thimble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pea and thimble,&rdquo; said the
landlord&mdash;&ldquo;not I; those <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>confounded
cocks left me nothing to lose by the pea and thimble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear
me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I thought that you knew your birds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, so I did,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I knew the birds
to be good birds, and so they proved, and would have won if better birds
had not been brought against them, of which I knew nothing, and so do
you see I am done, regularly done.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be cast down; there is one thing of which
the cocks by their misfortune cannot deprive you&mdash;your reputation;
make the most of that, give up cock-fighting, and be content with the
custom of your house, of which you will always have plenty, as long
as you are the wonder and glory of the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord struck the table before him violently with his fist.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Confound my reputation!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;No reputation
that I have will be satisfaction to my brewer for the seventy pounds
I owe him.&nbsp; Reputation won&rsquo;t pass for the current coin of
this here realm; and let me tell you, that if it a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t backed
by some of it, it a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a bit better than rotten cabbage,
as I have found.&nbsp; Only three weeks since I was, as I told you,
the wonder and glory of the neighbourhood; and people used to come and
look at me, and worship me; but as soon as it began to be whispered
about that I owed money to the brewer, they presently left off all that
kind of thing; and now, during the last three days, since the tale of
my misfortune with the cocks has got wind, almost everybody has left
off coming to the house, and the few who does, merely comes to insult
and flout me.&nbsp; It was only <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>last
night that fellow, Hunter, called me an old fool in my own kitchen here.&nbsp;
He wouldn&rsquo;t have called me a fool a fortnight ago&mdash;&rsquo;twas
I called him fool then, and last night he called me old fool; what do
you think of that? the man that beat Tom of Hopton to be called not
only a fool, but an old fool; and I hadn&rsquo;t heart, with one blow
of this here fist into his face, to send his head ringing against the
wall; for when a man&rsquo;s pocket is low, do you see, his heart a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
much higher.&nbsp; But it is no use talking, something must be done.&nbsp;
I was thinking of you just as you came in, for you are just the person
that can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to ask me to lend you the
money which you want, it will be to no purpose, as I have very little
of my own, just enough for my own occasions; it is true, if you desired
it, I would be your intercessor with the person to whom you owe the
money, though I should hardly imagine that anything I could say&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are right there,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;much the
brewer would care for anything you could say on my behalf&mdash;your
going would be the very way to do me up entirely.&nbsp; A pretty opinion
he would have of the state of my affairs if I were to send him such
a &rsquo;cessor as you; and as for your lending me money, don&rsquo;t
think I was ever fool enough to suppose either that you had any, or
if you had that you would be fool enough to lend me any.&nbsp; No, no,
the coves of the ring knows better; I have been in the ring myself,
and knows what fighting a cove is, and though I was fool enough to back
those birds, I was never quite fool enough to <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>lend
anybody money.&nbsp; What I am about to propose is something very different
from going to my landlord, or lending any capital; something which,
though it will put money into my pocket, will likewise put something
handsome into your own.&nbsp; I want to get up a fight in this here
neighbourhood, which would be sure to bring plenty of people to my house,
for a week before and after it takes place; and as people can&rsquo;t
come without drinking, I think I could, during one fortnight, get off
for the brewer all the sour and unsaleable liquids he now has, which
people wouldn&rsquo;t drink at any other time, and by that means, do
you see, liquidate my debt; then, by means of betting, making first
all right, do you see, I have no doubt that I could put something handsome
into my pocket and yours, for I should wish you to be the fighting man,
as I think I can depend upon you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You really must
excuse me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have no wish to figure as a pugilist,
besides there is such a difference in our ages; you may be the stronger
man of the two, and perhaps the hardest hitter, but I am in much better
condition, am more active on my legs, so that I am almost sure I should
have the advantage, for, as you very properly observed, &lsquo;Youth
will be served.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean to
fight,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I could beat you
if I were to train a little; but in the fight I propose I looks more
to the main chance than anything else.&nbsp; I question whether half
so many people could be brought together if you were to fight with me
as the person I have in view, or whether <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>there
would be half such opportunities for betting; for I am a man, do you
see; the person I wants you to fight with is not a man, but the young
woman you keeps company with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young woman I keep company with,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;pray
what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go into the bar, and have something,&rdquo; said the
landlord, getting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;My niece is out, and there is no
one in the house, so we can talk the matter over quietly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon I followed him into the bar, where, having drawn me a jug
of ale, helped himself as usual to a glass of sherry, and lighted a
cigar, he proceeded to explain himself further.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I
wants is to get up a fight between a man and a woman; there never has
yet been such a thing in the ring, and the mere noise of the matter
would bring thousands of people together, quite enough to drink out,
for the thing should be close to my house, all the brewer&rsquo;s stock
of liquids, both good and bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;you were the other day boasting of the respectability of your
house; do you think that a fight between a man and a woman close to
your establishment would add to its respectability?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound
the respectability of my house,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;will
the respectability of my house pay the brewer, or keep the roof over
my head?&nbsp; No, no! when respectability won&rsquo;t keep a man, do
you see, the best thing is to let it go and wander.&nbsp; Only let me
have my own way, and both the brewer, myself, and every one of us, will
be satisfied.&nbsp; And then the betting <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>&mdash;what
a deal we may make by the betting&mdash;and that we shall have all to
ourselves, you, I, and the young woman; the brewer will have no hand
in that.&nbsp; I can manage to raise ten pounds, and if by flashing
that about, I don&rsquo;t manage to make a hundred, call me a horse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the party should lose, on
whom you sport your money, even as the birds did?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
must first make all right,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;as I told
you before; the birds were irrational beings, and therefore couldn&rsquo;t
come to an understanding with the others, as you and the young woman
can.&nbsp; The birds fought fair; but I intend you and the young woman
should fight cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by cross?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
attempt to gammon me; you in the ring, and pretend not to know what
fighting cross is!&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t do, my fine fellow; but as
no one is near us, I will speak out.&nbsp; I intend that you and the
young woman should understand one another and agree beforehand which
should be beat; and if you take my advice you will determine between
you that the young woman shall be beat, as I am sure that the odds will
run high upon her, her character as a fist-woman being spread far and
wide, so that all the flats who think it will be all right, will back
her, as I myself would, if I thought it would be a fair thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you would not have us fight fair?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;because why?&nbsp;
I conceives that a cross is a certainty to those who are in it, whereas
by the fair <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>thing
one may lose all he has.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you
said the other day that you liked the fair thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That
was by way of gammon,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;just, do you
see, as a Parliament cove might say, speechifying from a barrel to a
set of flats, whom he means to sell.&nbsp; Come, what do you think of
the plan?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very ingenious one,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The folks in this neighbourhood are beginning to call me old
fool, but if they don&rsquo;t call me something else, when they sees
me friends with the brewer, and money in my pocket, my name is not Catchpole.&nbsp;
Come, drink your ale, and go home to the young gentlewoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; said I, rising from my seat, after finishing
the remainder of the ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll have any objection?&rdquo; said
the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do what?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to fight cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will do your best to persuade her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fool enough to wish to fight fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am wise enough to wish not to
fight at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s my brewer to be paid?&rdquo; said the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change my religion,&rdquo; said the landlord.</p>
<h2><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>CHAPTER
XII.&mdash;ANOTHER VISIT FROM THE MAN IN BLACK: HIS ESTIMATE OF MEZZOFANTE.</h2>
<p>One evening Belle and myself received another visit from the man
in black.&nbsp; After a little conversation of not much importance,
I asked him whether he would not take some refreshment, assuring him
that I was now in possession of some very excellent Hollands which,
with a glass, a jug of water, and a lump of sugar, were heartily at
his service; he accepted my offer, and Belle going with a jug to the
spring, from which she was in the habit of procuring water for tea,
speedily returned with it full of the clear, delicious water of which
I have already spoken.&nbsp; Having placed the jug by the side of the
man in black, she brought him a glass and spoon, and a teacup, the latter
containing various lumps of snowy-white sugar: in the meantime I had
produced a bottle of the stronger liquid.&nbsp; The man in black helped
himself to some water, and likewise to some Hollands, the proportion
of water being about two-thirds; then adding a lump of sugar, he stirred
the whole up, tasted it, and said that it was good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the good things of life,&rdquo; he added, after
a short pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the others?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Malvoisia sack,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and
partridge, and beccafico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you say to high mass?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>&ldquo;High
mass!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;however,&rdquo; he continued,
after a pause, &ldquo;I will be frank with you; I came to be so; I may
have heard high mass on a time, and said it too; but as for any predilection
for it, I assure you I have no more than for a long High Church sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak &agrave; la Margutte?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margutte!&rdquo; said the man in black, musingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Margutte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have read Pulci, I suppose?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the man in black, laughing; &ldquo;I
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be rendered into English,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;something
in this style:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To which Margutte answered with a sneer,<br />
I like the blue no better than the black,<br />
My faith consists alone in savoury cheer,<br />
In roasted capons, and in potent sack;<br />
But, above all, in famous gin and clear,<br />
Which often lays the Briton on his back,<br />
With lump of sugar, and with lymph from well,<br />
I drink it, and defy the fiends of hell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;that is more
than Mezzofante could have done for a stanza of Byron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clever man,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mezzofante di Bologna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;now I know
that you are not a Gypsy, at least a soothsayer; no soothsayer would
have said that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;does he not understand five-and-twenty tongues?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;and five-and-twenty
added to them; but&mdash;he! he! it was principally from him who is
certainly the Prince of Philologists that I formed my opinion of the
sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to speak of him with more respect,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I have heard say that he has done good service to your see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;he has done good
service to our see, that is, in his way; when the neophytes of the propaganda
are to be examined in the several tongues in which they are destined
to preach, he is appointed to question them, the questions being first
written down for him, or else, he! he! he!&nbsp; Of course you know
Napoleon&rsquo;s estimate of Mezzofante; he sent for the linguist from
motives of curiosity, and after some discourse with him, told him that
he might depart; then turning to some of his generals, he observed,
&lsquo;Nous avons eu ici un exemple qu&rsquo;un homme peut avoir beaucoup
de paroles avec bien peu d&rsquo;esprit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are ungrateful to him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;well, perhaps,
when he is dead and gone you will do him justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;when he is dead
and gone, we intend to erect him a statue of wood, on the left-hand
side of the door of the Vatican library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of wood?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the son of a carpenter, you know,&rdquo; said the man
in black; &ldquo;the figure will be of wood for no other reason, I assure
you; he! he!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>&ldquo;You
should place another statue on the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but
we know of no one amongst the philologists of Italy, nor, indeed, of
the other countries, inhabited by the faithful worthy, to sit parallel
in effigy with our illustrissimo; when, indeed, we have conquered those
regions of the perfidious by bringing the inhabitants thereof to the
true faith, I have no doubt that we shall be able to select one worthy
to bear him company, one whose statue shall be placed on the right hand
of the library, in testimony of our joy at his conversion; for, as you
know, &lsquo;There is more joy,&rsquo; etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;no, if I
be consulted as to the material for the statue, I should strongly recommend
bronze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the man in black had said this, he emptied his second tumbler
of its contents, and prepared himself another.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;THE MAN IN BLACK DISCUSSES THE FOIBLES OF
THE ENGLISH&mdash;HIS SCHEMES FOR WINNING OVER THE ARISTOCRACY, THE
MIDDLE CLASS, AND THE RABBLE&mdash;HORSEFLESH AND BITTER ALE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;So you hope to bring these regions again beneath the banner
of the Roman see?&rdquo; said I; after the man in black had prepared
the beverage, and tasted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;how can we fail?&nbsp;
<!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Is
not the Church of these regions going to lose its prerogative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its prerogative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; those who should be the guardians of the religion of
England are about to grant Papists emancipation and to remove the disabilities
from Dissenters, which will allow the Holy Father to play his own game
in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my inquiring how the Holy Father intended to play his game, the
man in black gave me to understand that he intended for the present
to cover the land with temples, in which the religion of Protestants
would be continually scoffed at and reviled.</p>
<p>On my observing that such behaviour would savour strongly of ingratitude,
the man in black gave me to understand that if I entertained the idea
that the See of Rome was ever influenced in its actions by any feeling
of gratitude I was much mistaken, assuring me that if the See of Rome
in any encounter should chance to be disarmed, and its adversary, from
a feeling of magnanimity, should restore the sword which had been knocked
out of its hand, the See of Rome always endeavoured on the first opportunity
to plunge the said sword into its adversary&rsquo;s bosom,&mdash;conduct
which the man in black seemed to think was very wise, and which he assured
me had already enabled it to get rid of a great many troublesome adversaries,
and would, he had no doubt, enable it to get rid of a great many more.</p>
<p>On my attempting to argue against the propriety of such behaviour,
the man in black cut the matter short, <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>by
saying, that if one party was a fool he saw no reason why the other
should imitate it in its folly.</p>
<p>After musing a little while I told him that emancipation had not
yet passed through the legislature, and that perhaps it never would,
reminding him that there was often many a slip between the cup and the
lip; to which observation the man in black agreed, assuring me, however,
that there was no doubt that emancipation would be carried, inasmuch
as there was a very loud cry at present in the land; a cry of &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo;
which had almost frightened the Government out of its wits; who, to
get rid of the cry, was going to grant all that was asked in the way
of toleration, instead of telling the people to &ldquo;Hold their nonsense,&rdquo;
and cutting them down, provided they continued bawling longer.</p>
<p>I questioned the man in black with respect to the origin of this
cry; but he said to trace it to its origin would require a long history;
that, at any rate, such a cry was in existence, the chief raisers of
it being certain of the nobility, called Whigs, who hoped by means of
it to get into power, and to turn out certain ancient adversaries of
theirs called Tories, who were for letting things remain <i>in statu
quo</i>; that these Whigs were backed by a party amongst the people
called Radicals, a specimen of whom I had seen in the public-house;
a set of fellows who were always in the habit of bawling against those
in place; &ldquo;and so,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;by means of these parties,
and the hubbub which the Papists and other smaller sects are making,
a general emancipation will be carried, and the Church of England humbled,
<!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>which
is the principal thing which the See of Rome cares for.&rdquo; <a name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153">{153}</a></p>
<p>On my telling the man in black that I believed that even among the
high dignitaries of the English Church there were many who wished to
grant perfect freedom to religions of all descriptions, he said: &ldquo;He
was aware that such was the fact, and that such a wish was anything
but wise, inasmuch as if they had any regard for the religion they professed,
they ought to stand by it through thick and thin, proclaiming it to
be the only true one, and denouncing all others, in an alliterative
style, as dangerous and damnable; whereas, by their present conduct,
they are bringing their religion into contempt with the people at large,
who would never continue long attached to a Church, the ministers of
which did not stand up for it, and likewise cause their own brethren,
who had a clearer notion of things, to be ashamed of belonging to it.&nbsp;
I speak advisedly,&rdquo; said he, in continuation; &ldquo;there is
one Platitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope there is only one,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you surely
would not adduce the likes and dislikes of that poor silly fellow as
the criterions of the opinions of any party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know him,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;nay, I
heard you mention him in the public-house; the fellow is not very wise,
I admit, but he has sense enough to know, that unless a Church can make
people hold their tongues when it thinks fit, it is scarcely deserving
the <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>name
of a Church; no, I think that the fellow is not such a very bad stick,
and that upon the whole he is, or rather was, an advantageous specimen
of the High Church English clergy, who, for the most part, so far from
troubling their heads about persecuting people, only think of securing
tithes, eating their heavy dinners, puffing out their cheeks with importance
on country justice benches, and occasionally exhibiting their conceited
wives, hoyden daughters, and gawky sons at country balls, whereas Platitude&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you said in the public-house that
the Church of England was a persecuting Church, and here in the dingle
you have confessed that one section of it is willing to grant perfect
freedom to the exercise of all religions, and the other only thinks
of leading an easy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying a thing in the public-house is a widely different thing
from saying it in the dingle,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;had
the Church of England been a persecuting Church, it would not stand
in the position in which it stands at present; it might, with its opportunities,
have spread itself over the greater part of the world.&nbsp; I was about
to observe, that instead of practising the indolent habits of his High
Church brethren, Platitude would be working for his money, preaching
the proper use of fire and faggot, or rather of the halter and the whipping-post,
encouraging mobs to attack the houses of Dissenters, employing spies
to collect the scandal of neighbourhoods, in order that he might use
it for sacerdotal purposes, and, in fact, endeavouring to turn an English
parish into something like a Jesuit benefice in the south of France.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>&ldquo;He
tried that game,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the parish said&mdash;&lsquo;Pooh,
pooh,&rsquo; and, for the most part, went over to the Dissenters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the man in black, taking a sip at his
glass, &ldquo;but why were the Dissenters allowed to preach? why were
they not beaten on the lips till they spat out blood, with a dislodged
tooth or two?&nbsp; Why, but because the authority of the Church of
England has, by its own fault, become so circumscribed that Mr. Platitude
was not able to send a host of beadles and sbirri to their chapel to
bring them to reason, on which account Mr. Platitude is very properly
ashamed of his Church, and is thinking of uniting himself with one which
possesses more vigour and authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have vigour and authority,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in
foreign lands, but in these kingdoms the day for practising its atrocities
is gone by.&nbsp; It is at present almost below contempt, and is obliged
to sue for grace <i>in form&acirc; pauperis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;but let it
once obtain emancipation, and it will cast its slough, put on its fine
clothes, and make converts by thousands.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a fine Church,&rsquo;
they&rsquo;ll say; &lsquo;with what authority it speaks&mdash;no doubts,
no hesitation, no sticking at trifles.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a contrast
to the sleepy English Church! they&rsquo;ll go over to it by millions,
till it preponderates here over every other, when it will of course
be voted the dominant one; and then&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo; and
here the man in black drank a considerable quantity of gin and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>&ldquo;What
then?&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;why, she will be true to
herself.&nbsp; Let Dissenters, whether they be Church of England, as
perhaps they may still call themselves, Methodist, or Presbyterian,
presume to grumble, and there shall be bruising of lips in pulpits,
tying up to whipping-posts, cutting off ears and noses&mdash;he! he!
the farce of King Log has been acted long enough; the time for Queen
Stork&rsquo;s tragedy is drawing nigh;&rdquo; and the man in black sipped
his gin and water in a very exulting manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the Church which, according to your assertion
in the public-house, never persecutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already given you an answer,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;with respect to the matter of the public-house; it is
one of the happy privileges of those who belong to my Church to deny
in the public-house what they admit in the dingle; <a name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156">{156}</a>
we have high warranty for such double speaking.&nbsp; Did not the foundation-stone
of our Church, St. Peter, deny in the public house what he had previously
professed in the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the people of
England, who have shown aversion to anything in the shape of intolerance,
will permit such barbarities as you have described?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them become Papists,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;only
let the majority become Papists, and you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will never become so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the good
sense of the people of England will never permit them to commit such
an absurdity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>&ldquo;The
good sense of the people of England?&rdquo; said the man in black, filling
himself another glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the good sense of not only the
upper, but the middle and lower classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of what description of people are the upper class?&rdquo;
said the man in black, putting a lump of sugar into his gin and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;monstrously fine people;
so, at least, they are generally believed to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;only those think
them so who don&rsquo;t know them.&nbsp; The male part of the upper
class are in youth a set of heartless profligates; in old age, a parcel
of poor, shaking, nervous paillards.&nbsp; The female part, worthy to
be the sisters and wives of such wretches, unmarried, full of cold vice,
kept under by vanity and ambition, but which, after marriage, they seek
not to restrain; in old age, abandoned to vapours and horrors, do you
think that such beings will afford any obstacle to the progress of the
Church in these regions, as soon as her movements are unfettered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot give an opinion; I know nothing of them, except from
a distance.&nbsp; But what think you of the middle classes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their chief characteristic,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;is a rage for grandeur and gentility; and that same rage makes
us quite sure of them in the long run.&nbsp; Every thing that&rsquo;s
lofty meets their unqualified approbation; whilst everything humble,
or, as they call it, &lsquo;low,&rsquo; is scouted by them.&nbsp; They
begin to have a vague idea that the religion which they have hitherto
professed <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>is
low; at any rate that it is not the religion of the mighty ones of the
earth, of the great kings and emperors whose shoes they have a vast
inclination to kiss, nor was used by the grand personages of whom they
have read in their novels and romances, their Ivanhoes, their Marmions,
and their Ladies of the Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that the writings of Scott have had any influence
in modifying their religious opinions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly I do,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
writings of that man have made them greater fools than they were before.&nbsp;
All their conversation now is about gallant knights, princesses, and
cavaliers, with which his pages are stuffed&mdash;all of whom were Papists,
or very high Church, which is nearly the same thing; and they are beginning
to think that the religion of such nice sweet-scented gentry must be
something very superfine.&nbsp; Why, I know at Birmingham the daughter
of an ironmonger, who screeches to the piano the Lady of the Lake&rsquo;s
hymn to the Virgin Mary, always weeps when Mary Queen of Scots is mentioned,
and fasts on the anniversary of the death of that very wise martyr,
Charles the First.&nbsp; Why, I would engage to convert such an idiot
to popery in a week, were it worth my trouble.&nbsp; O Cavaliere Gualtiero,
avete fatto molto in favore della Santa Sede!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he has done it unwittingly;
I never heard before that he was a favourer of the popish delusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in theory,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;Trust
any of the clan MacSycophant for interfering openly and <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>boldly
in favour of any cause on which the sun does not shine benignantly.&nbsp;
Popery is at present, as you say, suing for grace in these regions <i>in
form&acirc; pauperis</i>; but let royalty once take it up, let old gouty
George once patronize it, and I would consent to drink puddle-water,
if the very next time the canny Scot was admitted to the royal symposium
he did not say, &lsquo;By my faith, yere Majesty, I have always thought,
at the bottom of my heart, that popery, as ill scrapit tongues ca&rsquo;
it, was a very grand religion; I shall be proud to follow your Majesty&rsquo;s
example in adopting it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt not,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that both gouty George
and his devoted servant will be mouldering in their tombs long before
Royalty in England thinks about adopting popery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can wait,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;in these
days of rampant gentility, there will be no want of Kings nor of Scots
about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not Walters,&rdquo; said I. <a name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159">{159}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our work has been already tolerably well done by one,&rdquo;
said the man in black; &ldquo;but if we wanted literature we should
never lack in these regions hosts of literary men of some kind or other
to eulogise us, <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>provided
our religion were in the fashion, and our popish nobles choose, and
they always do our bidding, to admit the canaille to their tables, their
kitchen tables.&nbsp; As for literature in general,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the Santa Sede is not particularly partial to it, it may be employed
both ways.&nbsp; In Italy, in particular, it has discovered that literary
men are not always disposed to be lick-spittles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, Dante,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;A dangerous
personage; that poem of his cuts both ways; and then there was Pulci,
that Morgante of his cuts both ways, or rather one way, and that sheer
against us; and then there was Aretino, who dealt so hard with the poveri
frati; all writers, at least Italian ones, are not lick spittles.&nbsp;
And then in Spain,&mdash;&rsquo;tis true, Lope de Vega and Calderon
were most inordinate lick-spittles; the &lsquo;Principe Constante&rsquo;
of the last is a curiosity in its way; and then the &lsquo;Mary Stuart&rsquo;
of Lope; I think I shall recommend the perusal of that work to the Birmingham
ironmonger&rsquo;s daughter; she has been lately thinking of adding
&lsquo;a slight knowledge of the magneeficent language of the Peninsula&rsquo;
to the rest of her accomplishments, he! he! he! but then there was Cervantes,
starving, but straight; he deals us some hard knocks in that second
part of his Quixote; then there were some of the writers of the picaresque
novels.&nbsp; No; all literary men are not lick-spittles, whether in
Italy or Spain, or, indeed, upon the Continent; it is only in England
that all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;mind what you are about to say
of English literary men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>&ldquo;Why
should I mind?&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;there are no literary
men here.&nbsp; I have heard of literary men living in garrets, but
not in dingles, whatever philologists may do; I may, therefore, speak
out freely.&nbsp; It is only in England that literary men are invariably
lick-spittles; on which account, perhaps, they are so despised, even
by those who benefit by their dirty services.&nbsp; Look at your fashionable
novel writers, he! he! and above all at your newspaper editors, ho!
ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, of course, except the editors of the --- from your
censure of the last class?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;why, they might
serve as models in the dirty trade to all the rest who practise it.&nbsp;
See how they bepraise their patrons, the grand Whig nobility, who hope,
by raising the cry of liberalism, and by putting themselves at the head
of the populace, to come into power shortly.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish
to be hard, at present, upon those Whigs,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for
they are playing our game; but a time will come when, not wanting them,
we will kick them to a considerable distance: and then, when toleration
is no longer the cry, and the Whigs are no longer backed by the populace,
see whether the editors of the --- will stand by them; they will prove
themselves as expert lick-spittles of despotism as of liberalism.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t think they will always bespatter the Tories and Austria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am sorry to find that you entertain
so low an opinion of the spirit of English literary men; we will now
return, if you please, to the subject of the <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>middle
classes; I think your strictures upon them in general are rather too
sweeping&mdash;they are not altogether the foolish people you have described.&nbsp;
Look, for example, at that very powerful and numerous body the Dissenters,
the descendants of those sturdy Patriots who hurled Charles the Simple
from his throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some sturdy fellows amongst them, I do not deny,&rdquo;
said the man in black, &ldquo;especially amongst the preachers, clever
withal&mdash;two or three of that class nearly drove Mr. Platitude mad,
as perhaps you are aware, but they are not very numerous; and the old
sturdy sort of preachers are fast dropping off, and, as we observe with
pleasure, are generally succeeded by frothy coxcombs, whom it would
not be very difficult to gain over.&nbsp; But what we most rely upon
as an instrument to bring the Dissenters over to us is the mania for
gentility, which amongst them has of late become as great, and more
ridiculous, than amongst the middle classes belonging to the Church
of England.&nbsp; All the plain and simple fashions of their forefathers
they are either about to abandon, or have already done so.&nbsp; Look
at the most part of their chapels, no longer modest brick edifices,
situated in quiet and retired streets, but lunatic-looking erections,
in what the simpletons call the modern Gothic taste, of Portland-stone,
with a cross upon the top, and the site generally the most conspicuous
that can be found; and look at the manner in which they educate their
children, I mean those that are wealthy.&nbsp; They do not even wish
them to be Dissenters, &lsquo;the sweet dears shall enjoy the <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>advantages
of good society, of which their parents were debarred.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So the girls are sent to tip-top boarding schools, where amongst other
trash they read &lsquo;Rokeby,&rsquo; and are taught to sing snatches
from that high-flying ditty the &lsquo;Cavalier&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Would you match the base Skippon, and Massey,
and Brown,<br />
With the barons of England, who fight for the crown?&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he! he! their own names.&nbsp; Whilst the lads are sent to those
hot-beds of pride and folly&mdash;colleges, whence they return with
a greater contempt for everything &lsquo;low,&rsquo; and especially
for their own pedigree, than they went with.&nbsp; I tell you, friend,
the children of Dissenters, if not their parents, are going over to
the Church, as you call it, and the Church is going over to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see the justice of that latter assertion at all,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;some of the Dissenters&rsquo; children may be coming
over to the Church of England, and yet the Church of England be very
far from going over to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the high road for it, I assure you,&rdquo; said the man
in black, &ldquo;part of it is going to abandon, the rest to lose their
prerogative, and when a church no longer retains its prerogative, it
speedily loses its own respect, and that of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if the higher classes have all
the vices and follies which you represent, on which point I can say
nothing, as I have never mixed with them; and even supposing the middle
classes are the foolish beings you would fain make them, and which I
do <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>not
believe them as a body to be, you would still find some resistance amongst
the lower classes.&nbsp; I have a considerable respect for their good
sense and independence of character; but pray let me hear your opinion
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the lower classes,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;I
believe them to be the most brutal wretches in the world, the most addicted
to foul feeding, foul language, and foul vices of every kind; wretches
who have neither love for country, religion, nor anything save their
own vile selves.&nbsp; You surely do not think that they would oppose
a change of religion? why, there is not one of them but would hurrah
for the Pope, or Mahomet, for the sake of a hearty gorge and a drunken
bout, like those which they are treated with at election contests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your church any followers amongst them?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever there happens to be a Romish family of considerable
possessions,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;our church is sure
to have followers of the lower class, who have come over in the hope
of getting something in the shape of dole or donation.&nbsp; As, however,
the Romish is not yet the dominant religion, and the clergy of the English
establishment have some patronage to bestow, the churches are not quite
deserted by the lower classes; yet were the Romish to become the established
religion, they would, to a certainty, all go over to it; you can scarcely
imagine what a self-interested set they are&mdash;for example, the landlord
of that public-house in which I first met you, having lost a sum of
money upon a <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>cock-fight,
and his affairs in consequence being in a bad condition, is on the eve
of coming over to us, in the hope that two old Popish females of property,
whom I confess, will advance him a sum of money to set him up again
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what could have put such an idea into the poor fellow&rsquo;s
head?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he and I have had some conversation upon the state of
his affairs,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;I think he might make
a rather useful convert in these parts, provided things take a certain
turn, as they doubtless will.&nbsp; It is no bad thing to have a fighting
fellow, who keeps a public-house, belonging to one&rsquo;s religion.&nbsp;
He has been occasionally employed as a bully at elections by the Tory
party, and he may serve us in the same capacity.&nbsp; The fellow comes
of a good stock; I heard him say that his father headed the High Church
mob, who sacked and burnt Priestley&rsquo;s house at Birmingham towards
the end of the last century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A disgraceful affair,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a disgraceful affair?&rdquo; said the
man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assure you that nothing has occurred for
the last fifty years which has given the High Church party so much credit
in the eyes of Rome as that; we did not imagine that the fellows had
so much energy.&nbsp; Had they followed up that affair, by twenty others
of a similar kind, they would by this time have had everything in their
own power; but they did not, and, as a necessary consequence, they are
reduced to almost nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>&ldquo;I
suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that your church would have acted very
differently in its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has always done so,&rdquo; said the man in black, coolly
sipping.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our church has always armed the brute-population
against the genius and intellect of a country, provided that same intellect
and genius were not willing to become its instruments and eulogists;
and provided we once obtain a firm hold here again, we would not fail
to do so.&nbsp; We would occasionally stuff the beastly rabble with
horseflesh and bitter ale, and then halloo them on against all those
who were obnoxious to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horseflesh and bitter ale!&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;horseflesh and bitter
ale, the favourite delicacies of their Saxon ancestors, who were always
ready to do our bidding after a liberal allowance of such cheer.&nbsp;
There is a tradition in our church, that before the rabble of Penda,
at the instigation of Austin, attacked and massacred the presbyterian
monks of Bangor, they had been allowed a good gorge of horseflesh and
bitter ale.&nbsp; He! he! he!&rdquo; continued the man in black, &ldquo;what
a fine spectacle to see such a mob, headed by a fellow like our friend,
the landlord, sack the house of another Priestley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t deny that we have had a Priestley,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and admit the possibility of our having another?&nbsp;
You were lately observing that all English literary men were sycophants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lick-spittles,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;yes, I
admit that you have had a Priestley, but he was a Dissenter <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>of
the old sort; you have had him, and perhaps may have another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we may,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;But with respect
to the lower classes, have you mixed much with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mixed with all classes,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;and with the lower not less than the upper and middle, they are
much as I have described them; and of the three, the lower are the worst.&nbsp;
I never knew one of them that possessed the slightest principle . .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to know something of the English people,&rdquo; he
continued, after a moment&rsquo;s pause; &ldquo;I have been many years
amongst them labouring in the cause of the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your See must have had great confidence in your powers, when
it selected you to labour for it in these parts?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They chose me,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;principally
because, being of British extraction and education, I could speak the
English language and bear a glass of something strong.&nbsp; It is the
opinion of my See, that it would hardly do to send a missionary into
a country like this who is not well versed in English&mdash;a country
where they think, so far from understanding any language besides his
own, scarcely one individual in ten speaks his own intelligibly; or
an ascetic person where, as they say, high and low, male and female,
are, at some period of their lives, fond of a renovating glass, as it
is styled, in other words, of tippling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>&ldquo;Your
See appears to entertain a very strange opinion of the English,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not altogether an unjust one,&rdquo; said the man in black,
lifting the glass to his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is certainly very kind on its
part to wish to bring back such a set of beings beneath its wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to the kindness of my See,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;I have not much to say; my See has generally in what it
does a tolerably good motive; these heretics possess in plenty what
my See has a great hankering for, and can turn to a good account&mdash;money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The founder of the Christian religion cared nothing for money,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have we to do with what the founder of the Christian
religion cared for?&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;how could our
temples be built, and our priests supported without money?&nbsp; But
you are unwise to reproach us with a desire of obtaining money; you
forget that your own church, if the Church of England be your own church,
as I suppose it is, from the willingness which you displayed in the
public-house to fight for it, is equally avaricious; look at your greedy
Bishops, and your corpulent Rectors! do they imitate Christ in his disregard
for money?&nbsp; Go to! you might as well tell me that they imitate
Christ in his meekness and humility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whatever their faults may be,
you can&rsquo;t say that they go to Rome for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>The
man in black made no direct answer, but appeared by the motion of his
lips to be repeating something to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your glass is again empty,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;perhaps
you will replenish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black arose from his seat, adjusted his habiliments which
were rather in disorder, and placed upon his head his hat, which he
had laid aside, then, looking at me, who was still lying upon the ground,
he said&mdash;&ldquo;I might, perhaps, take another glass, though I
believe I have had quite as much as I can well bear; but I do not wish
to hear you utter anything more this evening after that last observation
of yours&mdash;it is quite original; I will meditate upon it on my pillow
this night after having said an ave and a pater&mdash;go to Rome for
money!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then made Belle a low bow, slightly motioned
to me with his hand, as if bidding farewell, and then left the dingle
with rather uneven steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Rome for money,&rdquo; I heard him say as he ascended
the winding path, &ldquo;he! he! he!&nbsp; Go to Rome for money, ho!
ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;LIFE IN THE DINGLE&mdash;ISOPEL IS INOCULATED
WITH TONGUES&mdash;A THUNDERSTORM.</h2>
<p>Nearly three days elapsed without anything of particular moment occurring.&nbsp;
Belle drove the little cart containing her merchandise about the neighbourhood,
<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>returning
to the dingle towards the evening.&nbsp; As for myself, I kept within
my wooded retreat, working during the periods of her absence leisurely
at my forge.&nbsp; Having observed that the quadruped which my companion
drove was as much in need of shoes as my own had been some time previously,
I had determined to provide it with a set, and during the aforesaid
periods occupied myself in preparing them.&nbsp; As I was employed three
mornings and afternoons about them, I am sure that the reader will agree
that I worked leisurely, or rather lazily.&nbsp; On the third day Belle
arrived somewhat later than usual; I was lying on my back at the bottom
of the dingle, employed in tossing up the shoes, which I had produced,
and catching them as they fell, some being always in the air mounting
or descending, somewhat after the fashion of the waters of a fountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you been absent so long?&rdquo; said I to Belle;
&ldquo;it must be long past four by the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been almost killed by the heat,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;I was never out in a more sultry day&mdash;the poor donkey, too,
could scarcely move along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall have fresh shoes,&rdquo; said I, continuing my exercise:
&ldquo;here they are, quite ready; to-morrow I will tack them on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are you playing with them in that manner?&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly in triumph at having made them, and partly to show
that I can do something besides making them; it is not every one, who,
after having made a set of <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>horse-shoes,
can keep them going up and down in the air, without letting one fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has now fallen on your chin,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another on my cheek,&rdquo; said I, getting up; &ldquo;it
is time to discontinue the game, for the last shoe drew blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle went to her own little encampment; and as for myself, after
having flung the donkey&rsquo;s shoes into my tent, I put some fresh
wood on the fire, which was nearly out, and hung the kettle over it.&nbsp;
I then issued forth from the dingle, and strolled round the wood that
surrounded it; for a long time I was busied in meditation, looking at
the ground, striking with my foot, half unconsciously, the tufts of
grass and thistles that I met in my way.&nbsp; After some time, I lifted
up my eyes to the sky, at first vacantly, and then with more attention,
turning my head in all directions for a minute or two; after which I
returned to the dingle.&nbsp; Isopel was seated near the fire, over
which the kettle was now hung; she had changed her dress&mdash;no signs
of the dust and fatigue of her late excursion remained; she had just
added to the fire a small billet of wood, two or three of which I had
left beside it; the fire cracked, and a sweet odour filled the dingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fond of sitting by a wood fire,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;when
abroad, whether it be hot or cold; I love to see the flames dart out
of the wood; but what kind is this, and where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ash,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;green ash.&nbsp; Somewhat
less than a week ago, whilst I was wandering along the road <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>by
the side of a wood, I came to a place where some peasants were engaged
in cutting up and clearing away a confused mass of fallen timber: a
mighty-aged oak had given way the night before, and in its fall had
shivered some smaller trees; the upper part of the oak, and the fragments
of the rest, lay across the road.&nbsp; I purchased, for a trifle, a
bundle or two, and the wood on the fire is part of it&mdash;ash, green
ash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes good the old rhyme,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;which
I have heard sung by the old women in the great house:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ash, when green,<br />
Is fire for a queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And on fairer form of queen, ash fire never shone,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;than on thine, O beauteous queen of the dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am half disposed to be angry with you, young man,&rdquo;
said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not entirely?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Belle made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had
no objection to the first part of the speech, but you did not like being
called queen of the dingle.&nbsp; Well, if I had the power, I would
make you queen of something better than the dingle&mdash;Queen of China.&nbsp;
Come, let us have tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something less would content me,&rdquo; said Belle, sighing
as she rose to prepare our evening meal.</p>
<p>So we took tea together, Belle and I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delicious <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>tea
is after a hot summer&rsquo;s day, and a long walk!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay it is most refreshing then,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
I have heard people say that they most enjoy it on a cold winter&rsquo;s
night, when the kettle is hissing on the fire, and their children playing
on the hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where does tea come from?&rdquo; she presently
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From China,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I just now mentioned it,
and the mention of it put me in mind of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of country is China?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very little about it; all I know is, that it is a very
large country far to the East, but scarcely large enough to contain
its inhabitants, who are so numerous, that though China does not cover
one-ninth part of the world, its inhabitants amount to one-third of
the population of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do they talk as we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no!&nbsp; I know nothing of their language; but I have heard
that it is quite different from all others, and so difficult that none
but the cleverest people amongst foreigners can master it, on which
account, perhaps, only the French pretend to know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the French so very clever, then?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say there are no people like them, at least in Europe.&nbsp;
But talking of Chinese reminds me that I have not for some time past
given you a lesson in Armenian.&nbsp; The word for tea in Armenian is&mdash;by-the-bye,
what is the Armenian word for tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
your affair, not mine,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;it seems hard that
the master should ask the scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whatever the word may be in Armenian,
it is a noun; and as we have never yet declined an Armenian noun together,
we may as well take this opportunity of declining one.&nbsp; Belle,
there are ten declensions in Armenian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a declension?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of declining a noun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in the civilest way imaginable, I decline the noun.&nbsp;
Is that a declension?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should never play on words; to do so is low, vulgar, smelling
of the pothouse, the workhouse.&nbsp; Belle, I insist on your declining
an Armenian noun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done so already,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go on in this way,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall decline
taking any more tea with you.&nbsp; Will you decline an Armenian noun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the language,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you must teach me languages, why not teach me French or Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of Chinese; and as for French, none but a Frenchman
is clever enough to speak it&mdash;to say nothing of teaching; no, we
will stick to Armenian, unless, indeed, you would prefer Welsh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welsh, I have heard, is vulgar,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;so,
if I must learn one of the two, I will prefer Armenian, which I never
heard of till you mentioned it to me; though of the two, I really think
Welsh sounds best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Armenian noun,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which I propose <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>for
your declension this night, is Dy&egrave;r, which signifieth Lord, or
Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It soundeth very like tyrant,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care not what it sounds like,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it is
the word I chose, though it is not of the first declension.&nbsp; Master,
with all its variations, being the first noun, the sound of which I
would have you learn from my lips.&nbsp; Come, let us begin&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A master Dyer, Of a master, Dy&egrave;rn.&nbsp; Repeat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word sounds very strange to me,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However, to oblige you I will do my best;&rdquo; and thereupon
Belle declined master in Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have declined the noun very well,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;that
is in the singular number; we will now go to the plural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the plural?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which implies more than one, for example, masters; you
shall now go through masters in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;never; it is bad to have
one master, but more I would never bear, whether in Armenian or English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I merely want
you to decline masters in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do decline them; I will have nothing to do with them, nor
with master either; I was wrong to&mdash;What sound is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not hear it, but I dare say it is thunder; in Armenian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what it is in Armenian; but why do you think it
is thunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>&ldquo;Ere
I returned from my stroll, I looked up into the heavens, and by their
appearance I judged that a storm was nigh at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you not tell me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never asked me about the state of the atmosphere, and
I am not in the habit of giving my opinion to people on any subject,
unless questioned.&nbsp; But, setting that aside, can you blame me for
not troubling you with forebodings about storm and tempest, which might
have prevented the pleasure you promised yourself in drinking tea, or
perhaps a lesson in Armenian, though you pretend to dislike the latter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dislike is not pretended,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I hate
the sound of it, but I love my tea, and it was kind of you not to wish
to cast a cloud over my little pleasures; the thunder came quite time
enough to interrupt it without being anticipated&mdash;there is another
peal&mdash;I will clear away, and see that my tent is in a condition
to resist the storm, and I think you had better bestir yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isopel departed, and I remained seated on my stone, as nothing belonging
to myself required any particular attention.&nbsp; In about a quarter
of an hour she returned, and seated herself upon her stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dark the place is become since I left you,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;just as if night were just at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up at the sky,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and you will not
wonder; it is all of a deep olive.&nbsp; The wind is beginning to rise;
hark how it moans among the branches; and see how their tops are bending&mdash;it
<!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>brings
dust on its wings&mdash;I felt some fall on my face; and what is this,
a drop of rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have plenty anon,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;do you
hear? it already begins to hiss upon the embers; that fire of ours will
soon be extinguished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not probable that we shall want it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
we had better seek shelter: let us go into my tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but you go in alone; as for
me, I will seek my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to be afraid of me; I
have taught you to decline master in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You almost tempt me,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;to make you
decline mistress in English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make matters short,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I decline a mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Belle, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have merely done what you wished me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
in your own style; there is no other way of declining anything in English,
for in English there are no declensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain is increasing,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I shall go to my tent; you
may come, if you please; I do assure you I am not afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I of you,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;so I will come.&nbsp;
Why should I be afraid?&nbsp; I can take my own part; that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went into the tent and sat down, and now the rain began to pour
with vehemence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope we <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>shall
not be flooded in this hollow,&rdquo; said I to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no fear of that,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;the wandering
people, amongst other names, call it the dry hollow.&nbsp; I believe
there is a passage somewhere or other by which the wet is carried off.&nbsp;
There must be a cloud right above us, it is so dark.&nbsp; Oh! what
a flash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a peal!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;that is what the Hebrews
call Koul Adonai&mdash;the voice of the Lord.&nbsp; Are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I rather like to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am fond of the sound
of thunder myself.&nbsp; There is nothing like it: Koul Adonai behadar;
the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice, as the prayer-book version
hath it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something awful in it,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and
then the lightning, the whole dingle is now in a blaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and
discovereth the thick bushes.&rsquo;&nbsp; As you say, there is something
awful in thunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are all kinds of noises above us,&rdquo; said Belle:
&ldquo;surely I heard the crashing of a tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar trees,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;but what you hear is caused by a convulsion of the air;
during a thunderstorm there are occasionally all kinds of a&euml;rial
noises.&nbsp; Ab Gwilym, who, next to King David, has best described
a thunderstorm, speaks of these a&euml;rial noises in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Astonied now I stand at strains,<br />
As of ten thousand clanking chains;<br />
<!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>And
once, methought, that overthrown,<br />
The welkin&rsquo;s oaks came whelming down;<br />
Upon my head upstarts my hair:<br />
Why hunt abroad the hounds of air?<br />
What cursed hag is screeching high,<br />
Whilst crash goes all her crockery?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would hardly believe, Belle, that though I offered at least ten
thousand lines nearly as good as those to the booksellers in London,
the simpletons were so blind to their interest as to refuse purchasing
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;especially
if such dreadful expressions frequently occur as that towards the end;
surely that was the crash of a tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there falls the cedar tree&mdash;I
mean the sallow; one of the tall trees on the outside of the dingle
has been snapped short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;that the fine old oak,
which you saw the peasants cutting up, gave way the other night, when
scarcely a breath of air was stirring: how much better to have fallen
in a storm like this, the fiercest I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;after braving
a thousand tempests, it was meeter for it to fall of itself than to
be vanquished at last.&nbsp; But to return to Ab Gwilym&rsquo;s poetry,
he was above culling dainty words, and spoke boldly his mind on all
subjects.&nbsp; Enraged with the thunder for parting him and Morfydd,
he says, at the conclusion of his ode,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My curse, O Thunder, cling to thee,<br />
For parting my dear pearl and me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>&ldquo;You
and I shall part; that is, I shall go to my tent if you persist in repeating
from him.&nbsp; The man must have been a savage.&nbsp; A poor wood-pigeon
has fallen dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there he lies just outside the
tent; often have I listened to his note when alone in this wilderness.&nbsp;
So you do not like Ab Gwilym; what say you to old G&ouml;the:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mist shrouds the night, and rack;<br />
Hear, in the woods, what an awful crack!<br />
Wildly the owls are flitting,<br />
Hark to the pillars splitting<br />
Of palaces verdant ever,<br />
The branches quiver and sever,<br />
The mighty stems are creaking,<br />
The poor roots breaking and shrieking,<br />
In wild mixt ruin down dashing,<br />
O&rsquo;er one another they&rsquo;re crashing;<br />
Whilst &rsquo;midst the rocks so hoary,<br />
Whirlwinds hurry and worry.<br />
Hear&rsquo;st not, sister&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;hark!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hear&rsquo;st not, sister, a chorus<br />
Of voices?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but I hear a voice.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>CHAPTER
XV.&mdash;FIRST AID TO A POSTCHAISE AND A POSTILLION&mdash;MORE HOSPITALITY.</h2>
<p>I listened attentively, but I could hear nothing but the loud clashing
of branches, the pattering of rain, and the muttered growl of thunder.&nbsp;
I was about to tell Belle that she must have been mistaken, when I heard
a shout, indistinct, it is true, owing to the noises aforesaid, from
some part of the field above the dingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will soon see
what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; said I to Belle, starting up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will go, too,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay where
you are,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if I need you I will call;&rdquo; and,
without waiting for an answer, I hurried to the mouth of the dingle.&nbsp;
I was about a few yards only from the top of the ascent, when I beheld
a blaze of light, from whence I knew not; the next moment there was
a loud crash, and I appeared involved in a cloud of sulphurous smoke.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us,&rdquo; I heard a voice say, and methought
I heard the plunging and struggling of horses.&nbsp; I had stopped short
on hearing the crash, for I was half stunned; but I now hurried forward,
and in a moment stood upon the plain.&nbsp; Here I was instantly aware
of the cause of the crash and the smoke.&nbsp; One of those balls, generally
called fire-balls, had fallen from the clouds, and was burning on the
plain at a short distance; and the voice which I had heard, and the
plunging, were as easily accounted for.&nbsp; Near the left-hand corner
of the grove which surrounded the dingle, and about ten <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>yards
from the fire-ball, I perceived a chaise, with a postillion on the box,
who was making efforts, apparently useless, to control his horses, which
were kicking and plunging in the highest degree of excitement.&nbsp;
I instantly ran towards the chaise, in order to offer what help was
in my power.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; said the poor fellow, as I
drew nigh; but before I could reach the horses, they had turned rapidly
round, one of the fore-wheels flew from its axle-tree, the chaise was
overset, and the postillion flung violently from his seat upon the field.&nbsp;
The horses now became more furious than before, kicking desperately,
and endeavouring to disengage themselves from the fallen chaise.&nbsp;
As I was hesitating whether to run to the assistance of the postillion,
or endeavour to disengage the animals, I heard the voice of Belle exclaiming,
&ldquo;See to the horses, I will look after the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
had, it seems, been alarmed by the crash which accompanied the fire-bolt,
and had hurried up to learn the cause.&nbsp; I forthwith seized the
horses by the heads, and used all the means I possessed to soothe and
pacify them, employing every gentle modulation of which my voice was
capable.&nbsp; Belle, in the meantime, had raised up the man, who was
much stunned by his fall; but presently recovering his recollection
to a certain degree, he came limping to me holding his hand to his right
thigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first thing that must now be done,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;is to free these horses from the traces; can you undertake
to do so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; said the man, looking
at me somewhat stupidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will help,&rdquo; said Belle,
and without loss of time <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>laid
hold of one of the traces.&nbsp; The man, after a short pause, also
set to work, and in a few minutes the horses were extricated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to the man, &ldquo;what is next to be done?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;indeed, I scarcely
know anything; I have been so frightened by this horrible storm, and
so shaken by my fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
the storm is passing away, so cast your fears away too; and as for your
fall, you must bear it as lightly as you can.&nbsp; I will tie the horses
amongst those trees, and then we will all betake us to the hollow below.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s to become of my chaise?&rdquo; said the postillion,
looking ruefully on the fallen vehicle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us leave the
chaise for the present,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we can be of no use to
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave my chaise lying
on the ground in this weather,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I love my
chaise, and him whom it belongs to.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are quite
right to be fond of yourself,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;on which account
I advise you to seek shelter from the rain as soon as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was not talking of myself,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but
my master, to whom the chaise belongs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought
you called the chaise yours,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my way of speaking,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but the chaise is my
master&rsquo;s, and a better master does not live.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you think we could manage to raise up the chaise?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what is to become of the horses?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love
my horses well enough,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but they will take
less harm than the chaise.&nbsp; We two can never lift up that chaise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But we three can,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;at least, I think
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>so;
and I know where to find two poles which will assist us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You had better go to the tent,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will
be wet through.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I care not for a little wetting,&rdquo;
said Belle; &ldquo;moreover, I have more gowns than one&mdash;see you
after the horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon, I led the horses past the
mouth of the dingle, to a place where a gap in the hedge afforded admission
to the copse or plantation, on the southern side.&nbsp; Forcing them
through the gap, I led them to a spot amidst the trees, which I deemed
would afford them the most convenient place for standing; then, darting
down into the dingle, I brought up a rope, and also the halter of my
own nag, and with these fastened them each to a separate tree in the
best manner I could.&nbsp; This done, I returned to the chaise and the
postillion.&nbsp; In a minute or two Belle arrived with two poles, which,
it seems, had long been lying, overgrown with brushwood, in a ditch
or hollow behind the plantation.&nbsp; With these both she and I set
to work in endeavouring to raise the fallen chaise from the ground.</p>
<p>We experienced considerable difficulty in this undertaking; at length,
with the assistance of the postillion, we saw our efforts crowned with
success&mdash;the chaise was lifted up, and stood upright on three wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may leave it here in safety,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for
it will hardly move away on three wheels, even supposing it could run
by itself; I am afraid there is work here for a wheelwright, in which
case I cannot assist you; if you were in need of a blacksmith it would
be other wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think either the wheel
or the axle <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>is
hurt,&rdquo; said the postillion, who had been handling both; &ldquo;it
is only the linch-pin having dropped out that caused the wheel to fly
off; if I could but find the linch-pin! though, perhaps, it fell out
a mile away.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
never mind the linch-pin, I can make you one, or something that will
serve: but I can&rsquo;t stay here any longer, I am going to my place
below with this young gentlewoman, and you had better follow us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said the man; and after lifting up the wheel
and propping it against the chaise, he went with us, slightly limping,
and with his hand pressed to his thigh.</p>
<p>As we were descending the narrow path, Belle leading the way, and
myself the last of the party, the postillion suddenly stopped short,
and looked about him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you stop?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to offend you,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but
this seems to be a strange place you are leading me into; I hope you
and the young gentlewoman, as you call her, don&rsquo;t mean me any
harm&mdash;you seemed in a great hurry to bring me here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We wished to get you out of the rain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
ourselves too; that is, if we can, which I rather doubt, for the canvas
of a tent is slight shelter in such a rain; but what harm should we
wish to do you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may think I have money,&rdquo;
said the man, &ldquo;and I have some, but only thirty shillings, and
for a sum like that it would be hardly worth while to&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Would it not?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;thirty shillings, after all,
are thirty shillings, and for what I know, half a dozen throats may
have been cut in this place for that sum <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>at
the rate of five shillings each; moreover, there are horses, which would
serve to establish this young gentlewoman and myself in housekeeping,
provided we were thinking of such a thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
I suppose I have fallen into pretty hands,&rdquo; said the man, putting
himself in a posture of defence; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll show no craven
heart; and if you attempt to lay hands on me, I&rsquo;ll try to pay
you in your own coin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m rather lamed in the leg, but I
can still use my fists; so come on, both of you, man and woman, if woman
this be, though she looks more like a grenadier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear no more of this nonsense,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;if
you are afraid, you can go back to your chaise&mdash;we only seek to
do you a kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he was just now talking about cutting throats,&rdquo;
said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You brought it on yourself,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;you suspected us, and he wished to pass a joke upon you; he would
not hurt a hair of your head, were your coach laden with gold, nor would
I.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I was wrong&mdash;here&rsquo;s
my hand to both of you,&rdquo; shaking us by the hands; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go with you where you please, but I thought this a strange lonesome
place, though I ought not much to mind strange lonesome places, having
been in plenty of such when I was a servant in Italy, without coming
to any harm&mdash;come, let us move on, for &rsquo;tis a shame to keep
you two in the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we descended the path which led into the depths of the dingle;
at the bottom I conducted the postillion to my tent, which, though the
rain dripped and trickled <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>through
it, afforded some shelter; there I bade him sit down on the log of wood,
while I placed myself as usual on my stone.&nbsp; Belle in the meantime
had repaired to her own place of abode.&nbsp; After a little time, I
produced a bottle of the cordial of which I have previously had occasion
to speak, and made my guest take a considerable draught.&nbsp; I then
offered him some bread and cheese, which he accepted with thanks.&nbsp;
In about an hour the rain had much abated.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
now propose to do?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo;
said the man; &ldquo;I suppose I must endeavour to put on the wheel
with your help.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How far are you from your home?&rdquo;
I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upwards of thirty miles,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My master keeps an inn on the great north road, and from thence
I started early this morning with a family which I conveyed across the
country to a hall at some distance from here.&nbsp; On my return I was
beset by the thunderstorm, which frightened the horses, who dragged
the chaise off the road into the field above, and overset it as you
saw.&nbsp; I had proposed to pass the night at an inn about twelve miles
from here on my way back, though how I am to get there to-night I scarcely
know, even if we can put on the wheel, for, to tell you the truth, I
am shaken by my fall, and the smoulder and smoke of that fire-ball have
rather bewildered my head; I am, moreover, not much acquainted with
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is to pass
the night here; I will presently light a fire, and endeavour to make
you comfortable&mdash;in the morning we will see <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>to
your wheel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I
shall be glad to pass the night here, provided I do not intrude, but
I must see to the horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I conducted the man
to the place where the horses were tied.&nbsp; &ldquo;The trees drip
rather upon them,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and it will not do for
them to remain here all night; they will be better out in the field
picking the grass, but first of all they must have a good feed of corn;&rdquo;
thereupon he went to his chaise, from which he presently brought two
small bags, partly filled with corn&mdash;into them he inserted the
mouths of the horses, tying them over their heads.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
we will leave them for a time,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;when I think
they have had enough, I will come back, tie their fore-legs, and let
them pick about.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;THE NEW-COMER TAKES KINDLY TO THE DINGLE AND
ITS OCCUPANTS, ABOUT WHOM HE FORMS HIS OWN OPINIONS.</h2>
<p>It might be about ten o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; Belle, the postillion,
and myself, sat just within the tent, by a fire of charcoal which I
had kindled in the chafing-pan.&nbsp; The man had removed the harness
from his horses, and, after tethering their legs, had left them for
the night in the field above, to regale themselves on what grass they
could find.&nbsp; The rain had long since entirely ceased, and the moon
and stars shone bright in the firmament, up to which, putting aside
the canvas, I occasionally <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>looked
from the depths of the dingle.&nbsp; Large drops of water, however,
falling now and then upon the tent from the neighbouring trees, would
have served, could we have forgotten it, to remind us of the recent
storm, and also a certain chilliness in the atmosphere, unusual to the
season, proceeding from the moisture with which the ground was saturated;
yet these circumstances only served to make our party enjoy the charcoal
fire the more.&nbsp; There we sat bending over it: Belle, with her long
beautiful hair streaming over her magnificent shoulders; the postillion
smoking his pipe, in his shirtsleeves and waistcoat, having flung aside
his great coat, which had sustained a thorough wetting; and I without
my waggoner&rsquo;s slop, of which, it being in the same plight, I had
also divested myself.</p>
<p>The new-comer was a well-made fellow of about thirty with an open
and agreeable countenance.&nbsp; I found him very well informed for
a man in his station, and with some pretensions to humour.&nbsp; After
we had discoursed for some time on indifferent subjects, the postillion,
who had exhausted his pipe, took it from his mouth, and, knocking out
the ashes upon the ground, exclaimed: &ldquo;I little thought, when
I got up in the morning, that I should spend the night in such agreeable
company, and after such a fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am glad that your opinion of
us has improved; it is not long since you seemed to hold us in rather
a suspicious light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;seeing the place
you were taking me to.&nbsp; I was not a little, but <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>very
much afraid of ye both; and so I continued for some time, though, not
to show a craven heart, I pretended to be quite satisfied; but I see
I was altogether mistaken about ye.&nbsp; I thought you vagrant Gypsy
folks and trampers; but now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vagrant Gypsy folks and trampers,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and
what are we but people of that stamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;if you wish to be thought
such, I am far too civil a person to contradict you, especially after
your kindness to me, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what do you mean by but?&nbsp;
I would have you to know that I am proud of being a travelling blacksmith:
look at these donkey-shoes, I finished them this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postillion took the shoes and examined them.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
you made these shoes?&rdquo; he cried at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I did; do you doubt it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I thought I should bring you
back to your original opinion.&nbsp; I am, then, a vagrant Gypsy body,
a tramper, a wandering blacksmith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a blacksmith, whatever else you may be,&rdquo; said the
postillion, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you account for my making those shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your not being a blacksmith,&rdquo; said the postillion;
&ldquo;no blacksmith would have made shoes in that manner.&nbsp; Besides,
what did you mean just now by saying you had finished these shoes to-day?
a real blacksmith would have flung off half-a-dozen sets of donkey shoes
in one <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>morning,
but you, I will be sworn, have been hammering at these for days, and
they do you credit, but why? because you are no blacksmith; no, friend,
your shoes may do for this young gentlewoman&rsquo;s animal, but I shouldn&rsquo;t
like to have my horses shod by you, unless at a great pinch indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for what do you take me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for some runaway young gentleman,&rdquo; said the postillion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No offence, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all; no one is offended at being taken or mistaken
for a young gentleman, whether runaway or not; but from whence do you
suppose I have run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, from college,&rdquo; said the man: &ldquo;no offence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever; and what induced me to run away from college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A love affair, I&rsquo;ll be sworn,&rdquo; said the postillion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You had become acquainted with this young gentle woman, so she
and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind how you get on, friend,&rdquo; said Belle, in a deep
serious tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray proceed,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I dare say you mean no
offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None in the world,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;all
I was going to say was that you agreed to run away together, you from
college and she from boarding-school.&nbsp; Well, there&rsquo;s nothing
to be ashamed of in a matter like that, such things are done every day
by young folks in high life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you offended?&rdquo; said I to Belle.</p>
<p><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Belle
made no answer; but, placing her elbows on her knees, buried her face
in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we ran away together?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;to Gretna Green,
though I can&rsquo;t say that I drove ye, though I have driven many
a pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from Gretna Green we came here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound you did,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;till
you could arrange matters at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the horse-shoes?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The donkey-shoes you mean,&rdquo; answered the postillion;
&ldquo;why, I suppose you persuaded the blacksmith who married you to
give you, before you left, a few lessons in his trade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we intend to stay here till we have arranged matters at
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;till the old people
are pacified, and they send you letters directed to the next post town,
to be left till called for, beginning with, &lsquo;Dear children,&rsquo;
and enclosing you each a cheque for one hundred pounds, when you will
leave this place, and go home in a coach like gentlefolks, to visit
your governors; I should like nothing better than to have the driving
of you: and then there will be a grand meeting of the two families,
and after a few reproaches, the old people will agree to do something
handsome for the poor thoughtless things; so you will have a genteel
house taken for you, and an annuity allowed you.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t
get much the first year, five hundred at the most, in order that the
old folks may let you feel <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>that
they are not altogether satisfied with you, and that you are yet entirely
in their power; but the second, if you don&rsquo;t get a cool thousand,
may I catch cold, especially should young madam here present a son and
heir for the old people to fondle, destined one day to become sole heir
of the two illustrious houses, and then all the grand folks in the neighbourhood,
who have, bless their prudent hearts! kept rather aloof from you till
then, for fear you should want anything from them&mdash;I say, all the
carriage people in the neighbourhood, when they see how swimmingly matters
are going on, will come in shoals to visit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are getting on swimmingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I was not a gentleman&rsquo;s
servant nine years without learning the ways of gentry, and being able
to know gentry when I see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you say to all this?&rdquo; I demanded of Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; interposed the postillion, &ldquo;I
have one more word to say, and when you are surrounded by your comforts,
keeping your nice little barouche and pair, your coachman and livery
servant, and visited by all the carriage people in the neighbourhood&mdash;to
say nothing of the time when you come to the family estates on the death
of the old people&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if now and then you
look back with longing and regret to the days when you lived in the
damp dripping dingle, had no better equipage than a pony or donkey-cart,
and saw no better company than a tramper or gypsy, <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>except
once, when a poor postillion was glad to seat himself at your charcoal
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;did you ever take lessons in elocution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not directly,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;but my old
master, who was in Parliament, did, and so did his son, who was intended
to be an orator.&nbsp; A great professor used to come and give them
lessons, and I used to stand and listen, by which means I picked up
a considerable quantity of what is called rhetoric.&nbsp; In what I
last said, I was aiming at what I have heard him frequently endeavouring
to teach my governors as a thing indispensably necessary in all oratory,
a graceful pere&mdash;pere&mdash;peregrination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peroration, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;and now I&rsquo;m
sure I am not mistaken about you; you have taken lessons yourself, at
first hand, in the college vacations, and a promising pupil you were,
I make no doubt.&nbsp; Well, your friends will be all the happier to
get you back.&nbsp; Has your governor much borough interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you once more,&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to Belle,
&ldquo;what you think of the history which this good man has made for
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I think of it,&rdquo; said Belle, still keeping
her face buried in her hands, &ldquo;but that it is mere nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the postillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May my leg always ache, if I do,&rdquo; said the postillion,
<!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>patting
his leg with his hand; &ldquo;will you persuade me that this young man
has never been at college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been at college, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to the best schools in Britain, to say nothing
of a celebrated one in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it comes to the same thing,&rdquo; said the postillion;
&ldquo;or perhaps you know more than if you had been at college&mdash;and
your governor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My governor, as you call him,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his borough interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father had no borough interest,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;had
he possessed any, he would perhaps not have died as he did, honourably
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;if he had had borough
interest, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been poor nor honourable, though perhaps
a right honourable.&nbsp; However, with your grand education and genteel
manners, you made all right at last by persuading this noble young gentlewoman
to run away from boarding-school with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never at a boarding-school,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;unless
you call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;boarding-school
is vulgar, I know: I beg your pardon, I ought to have called it academy,
or by some other much finer name&mdash;you were in something much greater
than a boarding-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are right,&rdquo; said Belle, lifting up her head
and looking the postillion full in the face by the <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>light
of the charcoal fire; &ldquo;for I was bred in the workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wooh!&rdquo; said the postillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that I am of good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;let us hear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of good blood,&rdquo; continued Belle; &ldquo;my name is Berners,
Isopel Berners, though my parents were unfortunate.&nbsp; Indeed, with
respect to blood, I believe I am of better blood than the young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;by my father&rsquo;s
side I am of Cornish blood, and by my mother&rsquo;s of brave French
Protestant extraction.&nbsp; Now, with respect to the blood of my father&mdash;and
to be descended well on the father&rsquo;s side is the principal thing&mdash;it
is the best blood in the world, for the Cornish blood, as the proverb
says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the proverb says,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;I say my blood is the best&mdash;my name is Berners, Isopel Berners&mdash;it
was my mother&rsquo;s name, and is better, I am sure, than any you bear,
whatever that may be; and though you say that the descent on the father&rsquo;s
side is the principal thing&mdash;and I know why you say so,&rdquo;
she added with some excitement&mdash;&ldquo;I say that descent on the
mother&rsquo;s side is of most account, because the mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just come from Gretna Green, and already quarrelling,&rdquo;
said the postillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not come from Gretna Green,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I had forgot,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;none
but great people go to Gretna Green.&nbsp; Well, then, from <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>church,
and already quarrelling about family, just like two great people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have never been to church,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and,
to prevent any more guessing on your part, it will be as well for me
to tell you, friend, that I am nothing to the young man, and he, of
course, nothing to me.&nbsp; I am a poor travelling girl, born in a
workhouse: journeying on my occasions with certain companions, I came
to this hollow, where my company quarrelled with the young man, who
had settled down here, as he had a right to do, if he pleased; and not
been able to drive him out, they went away after quarrelling with me,
too, for not choosing to side with them; so I stayed here along with
the young man, there being room for us both, and the place being as
free to me as to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, in order that you may be no longer puzzled with respect
to myself,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will give you a brief outline of
my history.&nbsp; I am the son of honourable parents, who gave me a
first-rate education, as far as literature and languages went, with
which education I endeavoured, on the death of my father, to advance
myself to wealth and reputation in the big city; but failing in the
attempt, I conceived a disgust for the busy world, and determined to
retire from it.&nbsp; After wandering about for some time, and meeting
with various adventures, in one of which I contrived to obtain a pony,
cart, and certain tools, used by smiths and tinkers, I came to this
place, where I amused myself with making horse-shoes, or rather pony-shoes,
having <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>acquired
the art of wielding the hammer and tongs from a strange kind of smith&mdash;not
him of Gretna Green&mdash;whom I knew in my childhood.&nbsp; And here
I lived, doing harm to no one, quite lonely and solitary, till one fine
morning the premises were visited by this young gentlewoman and her
companions.&nbsp; She did herself anything but justice when she said
that her companions quarrelled with her because she would not side with
them against me; they quarrelled with her, because she came most heroically
to my assistance as I was on the point of being murdered; and she forgot
to tell you, that after they had abandoned her she stood by me in the
dark hour, comforting and cheering me, when unspeakable dread, to which
I am occasionally subject, took possession of my mind.&nbsp; She says
she is nothing to me, even as I am nothing to her.&nbsp; I am of course
nothing to her, but she is mistaken in thinking she is nothing to me.&nbsp;
I entertain the highest regard and admiration for her, being convinced
that I might search the whole world in vain for a nature more heroic
and devoted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for my part,&rdquo; said Belle, with a sob, &ldquo;a more
quiet, agreeable partner in a place like this I would not wish to have;
it is true he has strange ways, and frequently puts words into my mouth
very difficult to utter; but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; and here she buried
her face once more in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I have been mistaken
about you; that is, not altogether, but in part.&nbsp; You are not rich
folks, it seems, but you are not common <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>people,
and that I could have sworn.&nbsp; What I call a shame is, that some
people I have known are not in your place and you in theirs,&mdash;you
with their estates and borough interest, they in this dingle with these
carts and animals; but there is no help for these things.&nbsp; Were
I the great Mumbo Jumbo above, I would endeavour to manage matters better;
but being a simple postillion, glad to earn three shillings a day, I
can&rsquo;t be expected to do much . . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Here the postillion tells his story.&nbsp; After they have heard
it, Lavengro, Isopel, and the narrator roll themselves in their several
blankets and bid one another &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;]</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;THE MAKING OF THE LINCH-PIN&mdash;THE SOUND
SLEEPER&mdash;BREAKFAST&mdash;THE POSTILLION&rsquo;S DEPARTURE.</h2>
<p>I awoke at the first break of day, and, leaving the postillion fast
asleep, stepped out of the tent.&nbsp; The dingle was dank and dripping.&nbsp;
I lighted a fire of coals, and got my forge in readiness.&nbsp; I then
ascended to the field, where the chaise was standing as we had left
it on the previous evening.&nbsp; After looking at the cloud-stone near
it, now cold, and split into three pieces, I set about prying narrowly
into the condition of the wheel and axle-tree&mdash;the latter had sustained
no damage of any consequence, and the wheel, as far as I was able to
judge, was sound, being only slightly injured in the box.&nbsp; The
only thing requisite to set the <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>chaise
in a travelling condition appeared to be a linch-pin, which I determined
to make.&nbsp; Going to the companion wheel, I took out the linch-pin,
which I carried down with me to the dingle, to serve me as a model.</p>
<p>I found Belle by this time dressed, and seated near the forge: with
a slight nod to her like that which a person gives who happens to see
an acquaintance when his mind is occupied with important business, I
forthwith set about my work.&nbsp; Selecting a piece of iron which I
thought would serve my purpose, I placed it in the fire, and plying
the bellows in a furious manner, soon made it hot; then seizing it with
the tongs, I laid it on my anvil, and began to beat it with my hammer,
according to the rules of my art.&nbsp; The dingle resounded with my
strokes.&nbsp; Belle sat still, and occasionally smiled, but suddenly
started up and retreated towards her encampment, on a spark which I
purposely sent in her direction alighting on her knee.&nbsp; I found
the making of a linch-pin no easy matter; it was, however, less difficult
than the fabrication of a pony-shoe; my work, indeed, was much facilitated
by my having another pin to look at.&nbsp; In about three-quarters of
an hour I had succeeded tolerably well, and had produced a linch-pin
which I thought would serve.&nbsp; During all this time, notwithstanding
the noise which I was making, the postillion never showed his face.&nbsp;
His non-appearance at first alarmed me: I was afraid he might be dead,
but, on looking into the tent, I found him still buried in the soundest
sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must surely be descended from one of the seven
sleepers,&rdquo; said I, <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>as
I turned away and resumed my work.&nbsp; My work finished, I took a
little oil, leather, and sand, and polished the pin as well as I could;
then, summoning Belle, we both went to the chaise, where, with her assistance,
I put on the wheel.&nbsp; The linch-pin which I had made fitted its
place very well, and having replaced the other, I gazed at the chaise
for some time with my heart full of that satisfaction which results
from the consciousness of having achieved a great action; then, after
looking at Belle in the hope of obtaining a compliment from her lips,
which did not come, I returned to the dingle, without saying a word,
followed by her.&nbsp; Belle set about making preparations for breakfast;
and I, taking the kettle, went and filled it at the spring.&nbsp; Having
hung it over the fire, I went to the tent in which the postillion was
still sleeping, and called upon him to arise.&nbsp; He awoke with a
start, and stared around him at first with the utmost surprise, not
unmixed, I could observe, with a certain degree of fear.&nbsp; At last,
looking in my face, he appeared to recollect himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
had quite forgot,&rdquo; said he, as he got up, &ldquo;where I was,
and all that happened yesterday.&nbsp; However, I remember now the whole
affair, thunderstorm, thunder-bolt, frightened horses, and all your
kindness.&nbsp; Come, I must see after my coach and horses; I hope we
shall be able to repair the damage.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The damage is
already quite repaired,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as you will see, if you
come to the field above.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo;
said the postillion, coming out of the tent; &ldquo;well, I am mightily
beholden to you.&nbsp; Good <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>morning,
young gentlewoman,&rdquo; said he, addressing Belle, who, having finished
her preparations, was seated near the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good morning,
young man,&rdquo; said Belle: &ldquo;I suppose you would be glad of
some breakfast; however, you must wait a little, the kettle does not
boil.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and look at your chaise,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;but tell me how it happened that the noise which I have been
making did not awake you; for three-quarters of an hour at least I was
hammering close at your ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard you all the
time,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;but your hammering made me
sleep all the sounder; I am used to hear hammering in my morning sleep.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a forge close by the room where I sleep when I&rsquo;m
at home, at my inn; for we have all kinds of conveniences at my inn&mdash;forge,
carpenter&rsquo;s shop, and wheelwright&rsquo;s,&mdash;so that when
I heard you hammering, I thought, no doubt, that it was the old noise,
and that I was comfortable in my bed at my own inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
now ascended to the field, where I showed the postillion his chaise.&nbsp;
He looked at the pin attentively, rubbed his hands, and gave a loud
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not well done?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
will do till I get home,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that is
all you have to say?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
a good deal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;considering who made it.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t be offended,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall prize it all
the more for its being made by a gentleman, and no blacksmith; and so
will my governor, when I show it to him.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let it
remain where it is, but will keep it, as a remembrance of you, as long
as I live.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then again rubbed his <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>hands
with great glee, and said, &ldquo;I will now go and see after my horses,
and then to breakfast, partner, if you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suddenly,
however, looking at his hands, he said, &ldquo;Before sitting down to
breakfast, I am in the habit of washing my hands and face: I suppose
you could not furnish me with a little soap and water.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;As much water as you please,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but if you
want soap, I must go and trouble the young gentlewoman for some.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;water will do
at a pinch.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said I; and leading
him to the pond of the frogs and newts, I said, &ldquo;This is my ewer;
you are welcome to part of it&mdash;the water is so soft that it is
scarcely necessary to add soap to it;&rdquo; then lying down on the
bank, I plunged my head into the water, then scrubbed my hands and face,
and afterwards wiped them with some long grass which grew on the margin
of the pond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I
see you know how to make a shift;&rdquo; he then followed my example,
declared he never felt more refreshed in his life, and, giving a bound,
said, &ldquo;he would go and look after his horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We then went to look after the horses, which we found not much the
worse for having spent the night in the open air.&nbsp; My companion
again inserted their heads in the corn-bags, and, leaving the animals
to discuss their corn, returned with me to the dingle, where we found
the kettle boiling.&nbsp; We sat down, and Belle made tea and did the
honours of the meal.&nbsp; The postillion was in high spirits, ate heartily,
and, to Belle&rsquo;s evident satisfaction, declared that he had never
drank better <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>tea
in his life, or indeed any half so good.&nbsp; Breakfast over, he said
that he must now go and harness his horses, as it was high time for
him to return to his inn.&nbsp; Belle gave him her hand and wished him
farewell: the postillion shook her hand warmly, and was advancing close
up to her&mdash;for what purpose I cannot say&mdash;whereupon Belle,
withdrawing her hand, drew herself up with an air which caused the postillion
to retreat a step or two with an exceedingly sheepish look.&nbsp; Recovering
himself, however, he made a low bow, and proceeded up the path.&nbsp;
I attended him, and helped to harness his horses and put them to the
vehicle; he then shook me by the hand, and taking the reins and whip
mounted to his seat; ere he drove away he thus addressed me: &ldquo;If
ever I forget your kindness and that of the young woman below, dash
my buttons.&nbsp; If ever either of you should enter my inn you may
depend upon a warm welcome, the best that can be set before you, and
no expense to either, for I will give both of you the best of characters
to the governor, who is the very best fellow upon all the road.&nbsp;
As for your linch-pin, I trust it will serve till I get home, when I
will take it out and keep it in remembrance of you all the days of my
life;&rdquo; then giving the horses a jerk with his reins, he cracked
his whip and drove off.</p>
<p>I returned to the dingle, Belle had removed the breakfast things,
and was busy in her own encampment: nothing occurred, worthy of being
related, for two hours, at the end of which time Belle departed on a
short expedition, and I again found myself alone in the dingle.</p>
<h2><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>CHAPTER
XVIII.&mdash;THE MAN IN BLACK&mdash;THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY&mdash;NEPOTISM&mdash;DONNA
OLYMPIA&mdash;OMNIPOTENCE&mdash;CAMILLO ASTALLI&mdash;THE FIVE PROPOSITIONS.</h2>
<p>In the evening I received another visit from the man in black.&nbsp;
I had been taking a stroll in the neighbourhood, and was sitting in
the dingle in rather a listless manner, scarcely knowing how to employ
myself; his coming, therefore, was by no means disagreeable to me.&nbsp;
I produced the hollands and glass from my tent, where Isopel Berners
had requested me to deposit them, and also some lump sugar, then taking
the gotch I fetched water from the spring, and, sitting down, begged
the man in black to help himself; he was not slow in complying with
my desire, and prepared for himself a glass of hollands and water with
a lump of sugar in it.&nbsp; After he had taken two or three sips with
evident satisfaction, I, remembering his chuckling exclamation of &ldquo;Go
to Rome for money,&rdquo; when he last left the dingle, took the liberty,
after a little conversation, of reminding him of it, whereupon, with
a he! he! he! he replied, &ldquo;Your idea was not quite so original
as I supposed.&nbsp; After leaving you the other night I remembered
having read of an emperor of Germany who conceived the idea of applying
to Rome for money, and actually put it into practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urban the Eighth then occupied the papal chair, of the family
of the Barberini, nicknamed the Mosche, <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>or
Flies, from the circumstance of bees being their armorial bearing.&nbsp;
The Emperor having exhausted all his money in endeavouring to defend
the church against Gustavus Adolphus, the great King of Sweden, who
was bent on its destruction, applied in his necessity to the Pope for
a loan of money.&nbsp; The Pope, however, and his relations, whose cellars
were at that time full of the money of the church, which they had been
plundering for years, refused to lend him a scudo; whereupon a pasquinade
picture was stuck up at Rome, representing the church lying on a bed,
gashed with dreadful wounds, and beset all over with flies, which were
sucking her, whilst the Emperor of Germany was kneeling before her with
a miserable face, requesting a little money towards carrying on the
war against the heretics, to which the poor church was made to say:
&lsquo;How can I assist you, O my champion, do you not see that the
flies have sucked me to the very bones?&rsquo;&nbsp; Which story,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;shows that the idea of going to Rome for money was not
quite so original as I imagined the other night, though utterly preposterous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This affair,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;occurred in what were
called the days of nepotism.&nbsp; Certain popes, who wished to make
themselves in some degree independent of the cardinals, surrounded themselves
with their nephews, and the rest of their family, who sucked the church
and Christendom as much as they could, none doing so more effectually
than the relations of Urban the Eighth, at whose death, according to
the book called the &ldquo;Nipotismo di Roma,&rdquo; there were in the
Barberini family <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>two
hundred and twenty-seven governments, abbeys, and high dignities; and
so much hard cash in their possession that threescore and ten mules
were scarcely sufficient to convey the plunder of one of them to Palestrina.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He added, however, that it was probable that Christendom fared better
whilst the popes were thus independent, as it was less sucked, whereas
before and after that period, it was sucked by hundreds instead of tens,
by the cardinals and all their relations, instead of by the pope and
his nephews only.</p>
<p>Then, after drinking rather copiously of his hollands, he said that
it was certainly no bad idea of the popes to surround themselves with
nephews, on whom they bestowed great church dignities, as by so doing
they were tolerably safe from poison, whereas a pope, if abandoned to
the cardinals, might at any time be made away with by them, provided
they thought that he lived too long, or that he seemed disposed to do
anything which they disliked; adding, that Ganganelli would never have
been poisoned provided he had had nephews about him to take care of
his life, and to see that nothing unholy was put into his food, or a
bustling stirring brother&rsquo;s wife like Donna Olympia.&nbsp; He
then with a he! he! he! asked me if I had ever read the book called
the &ldquo;Nipotismo di Roma&rdquo;; and on my replying in the negative,
he told me that it was a very curious and entertaining book, which he
occasionally looked at in an idle hour, and proceeded to relate to me
anecdotes out of the &ldquo;Nipotismo di Roma&rdquo; about the successor
of Urban, Innocent the Tenth, and Donna <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Olympia,
showing how fond he was of her, and how she cooked his food, and kept
the cardinals away from it, and how she and her creatures plundered
Christendom, with the sanction of the Pope until Christendom, becoming
enraged, insisted that he should put her away, which he did for a time,
putting a nephew&mdash;one Camillo Astalli&mdash;in her place, in which,
however, he did not continue long for the Pope, conceiving a pique against
him, banished him from his sight, and recalled Donna Olympia, who took
care of his food, and plundered Christendom until Pope Innocent died.</p>
<p>I said that I only wondered that between pope and cardinals the whole
system of Rome had not long fallen to the ground, and was told in reply,
that its not having fallen was the strongest proof of its vital power,
and the absolute necessity for the existence of the system.&nbsp; That
the system, notwithstanding its occasional disorders, went on.&nbsp;
Popes and cardinals might prey upon its bowels, and sell its interests,
but the system survived.&nbsp; The cutting off of this or that member
was not able to cause Rome any vital loss; for, as soon as she lost
a member, the loss was supplied by her own inherent vitality; though
her popes had been poisoned by cardinals, and her cardinals by popes;
and though priests occasionally poisoned popes, cardinals, and each
other, after all that had been, and might be, she had still, and would
ever have, her priests, cardinals, and pope.</p>
<p>Finding the man in black so communicative and reasonable, I determined
to make the best of my opportunity, and learn from him all I could with
respect <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>to
the papal system, and told him that he would particularly oblige me
by telling me who the Pope of Rome was; and received for answer, that
he was an old man elected by a majority of cardinals to the papal chair;
who, immediately after his election, became omnipotent and equal to
God on earth.&nbsp; On my begging him not to talk such nonsense, and
asking him how a person could be omnipotent who could not always preserve
himself from poison, even when fenced round by nephews, or protected
by a bustling woman, he, after taking a long sip of hollands and water,
told me that I must not expect too much from omnipotence; for example,
that as it would be unreasonable to expect that One above could annihilate
the past&mdash;for instance, the Seven Years&rsquo; War, or the French
Revolution&mdash;though any one who believed in Him would acknowledge
Him to be omnipotent, so would it be unreasonable for the faithful to
expect that the Pope could always guard himself from poison.&nbsp; Then,
after looking at me for a moment steadfastly, and taking another sip,
he told me that popes had frequently done impossibilities; for example,
Innocent the Tenth had created a nephew: for, not liking particularly
any of his real nephews, he had created the said Camillo Astalli his
nephew; asking me, with a he! he!&nbsp; &ldquo;What but omnipotence
could make a young man nephew to a person to whom he was not in the
slightest degree related?&rdquo;&nbsp; On my observing that of course
no one believed that the young fellow was really the pope&rsquo;s nephew,
though the pope might have adopted him as such, the man <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>in
black replied, &ldquo;that the reality of the nephewship of Camillo
Astalli had hitherto never become a point of faith; let, however, the
present pope, or any other pope, proclaim that it is necessary to believe
in the reality of the nephewship of Camillo Astalli, and see whether
the faithful would not believe in it.&nbsp; Who can doubt that,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;seeing that they believe in the reality of the five
propositions of Jansenius?&nbsp; The Jesuits, wishing to ruin the Jansenists,
induced a pope to declare that such and such damnable opinions, which
they called five propositions, were to be found in a book written by
Jansen, though in reality no such propositions were to be found there;
whereupon the existence of these propositions became forthwith a point
of faith to the faithful.&nbsp; Do you then think,&rdquo; he demanded,
&ldquo;that there is one of the faithful who would not swallow, if called
upon, the nephewship of Camillo Astalli as easily as the five propositions
of Jansenius?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the
faithful must be a pretty pack of simpletons!&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon
the man in black exclaimed, &ldquo;What! a Protestant, and an infringer
of the rights of faith!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a fellow, who would feel
himself insulted if any one were to ask him how he could believe in
the miraculous conception, calling people simpletons who swallow the
five propositions of Jansenius, and are disposed, if called upon, to
swallow the reality of the nephewship of Camillo Astalli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to speak, when I was interrupted by the arrival of Belle.&nbsp;
After unharnessing her donkey, and adjusting her person a little, she
came and sat down <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>by
us.&nbsp; In the meantime I had helped my companion to some more hollands
and water, and had plunged with him into yet deeper discourse.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;NECESSITY OF RELIGION&mdash;THE GREAT INDIAN
ONE&mdash;IMAGE WORSHIP&mdash;SHAKESPEARE&mdash;THE PAT ANSWER&mdash;KRISHNA&mdash;AMEN.</h2>
<p>Having told the man in black that I should like to know all the truth
with regard to the Pope and his system, he assured me he should be delighted
to give me all the information in his power; that he had come to the
dingle, not so much for the sake of the good cheer which I was in the
habit of giving him, as in the hope of inducing me to enlist under the
banners of Rome, and to fight in her cause; and that he had no doubt
that, by speaking out frankly to me, he ran the best chance of winning
me over.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to tell me that the experience of countless ages
had proved the necessity of religion; the necessity, he would admit,
was only for simpletons; but as nine-tenths of the dwellers upon this
earth were simpletons, it would never do for sensible people to run
counter to their folly, but, on the contrary, it was the wisest course
to encourage them in it, always provided that, by so doing, sensible
people could derive advantage; that the truly sensible people of this
world were the priests, who, without caring a straw for <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>religion
for its own sake, made use of it as a cord by which to draw the simpletons
after them; that there were many religions in this world, all of which
had been turned to excellent account by the priesthood; but that the
one the best adapted for the purposes of priestcraft was the popish,
which, he said, was the oldest in the world and the best calculated
to endure.&nbsp; On my inquiring what he meant by saying the popish
religion was the oldest in the world, whereas there could be no doubt
that the Greek and Roman religion had existed long before it, to say
nothing of the old Indian religion still in existence and vigour; he
said, with a nod, after taking a sip at his glass, that, between me
and him, the popish religion, that of Greece and Rome, and the old Indian
system were, in reality, one and the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me that you intended to be frank,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;but, however frank you may be, I think you are rather wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We priests of Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;even
those amongst us who do not go much abroad, know a great deal about
church matters, of which you heretics have very little idea.&nbsp; Those
of our brethren of the Propaganda, on their return home from distant
missions, not unfrequently tell us very strange things relating to our
dear mother; for example, our first missionaries to the East were not
slow in discovering and telling to their brethren that our religion
and the great Indian one were identical, no more difference between
them than between Ram and Rome.&nbsp; Priests, <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>convents,
beads, prayers, processions, fastings, penances, all the same, not forgetting
anchorites and vermin, he! he!&nbsp; The pope they found under the title
of the grand lama, a sucking child surrounded by an immense number of
priests.&nbsp; Our good brethren, some two hundred years ago, had a
hearty laugh, which their successors have often re-echoed; they said
that helpless suckling and its priests put them so much in mind of their
own old man, surrounded by his cardinals, he! he!&nbsp; Old age is second
childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they find Christ?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found him too,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;that
is, they saw his image; he is considered in India as a pure kind of
being, and on that account, perhaps, is kept there rather in the background,
even as he is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this is very mysterious to me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but of this
I am tolerably sure, and so are most of those of Rome, that modern Rome
had its religion from ancient Rome, which had its religion from the
East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was brought about, I believe, by the wanderings of nations,&rdquo;
said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;A brother of the Propaganda, a very
learned man, once told me&mdash;I do not mean Mezzofante, who has not
five ideas&mdash;this brother once told me that all we of the Old World,
from Calcutta to Dublin, are of the same stock, and were originally
of the same language, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of one religion,&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p><!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>&ldquo;All
of one religion,&rdquo; said the mad in black; &ldquo;and now follow
different modifications of the same religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Christians are not image-worshippers,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heretics are not, you mean,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;but you will be put down, just as you have always been, though
others may rise up after you; the true religion is image-worship; people
may strive against it, but they will only work themselves to an oil;
how did it fare with that Greek Emperor, the Iconoclast, what was his
name, Leon the Isaurian?&nbsp; Did not his image-breaking cost him Italy,
the fairest province of his empire, and did not ten fresh images start
up at home for every one which he demolished?&nbsp; Oh! you little know
the craving which the soul sometimes feels after a good bodily image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have indeed no conception of it,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
have an abhorrence of idolatry&mdash;the idea of bowing before a graven
figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle, who had now joined us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never bow before that of Shakespeare?&rdquo; said
the man in black, addressing himself to me, after a low bow to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that I ever did,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
even suppose I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you did,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;shame
on you, Mr. Hater of Idolatry; why, the very supposition brings you
to the ground; you must make figures of Shakespeare, must you? then
why not of St. Antonio, or Ignacio, or of a greater personage <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>still?&nbsp;
I know what you are going to say,&rdquo; he cried, interrupting me as
I was about to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make his image in
order to pay it divine honours, but only to look at it, and think of
Shakespeare; but this looking at a thing in order to think of a person
is the very basis of idolatry.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s works are not
sufficient for you; no more are the Bible or the legend of Saint Antony
or Saint Ignacio for us, that is for those of us who believe in them;
I tell you, Zingaro, that no religion can exist long which rejects a
good bodily image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that Shakespeare&rsquo;s
works would not exist without his image?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;that Shakespeare&rsquo;s
image is looked at more than his works, and will be looked at, and perhaps
adored, when they are forgotten.&nbsp; I am surprised that they have
not been forgotten long ago; I am no admirer of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how you will
put aside the authority of Moses.&nbsp; If Moses strove against image-worship,
should not his doing so be conclusive as to the impropriety of the practice;
what higher authority can you have than that of Moses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The practice of the great majority of the human race,&rdquo;
said the man in black, &ldquo;and the recurrence to image-worship, where
image-worship has been abolished.&nbsp; Do you know that Moses is considered
by the church as no better than a heretic, and though, for particular
reasons, it has been obliged to adopt his writings, the adoption was
merely a sham one, <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>as
it never paid the slightest attention to them?&nbsp; No, no, the church
was never led by Moses, nor by one mightier than he, whose doctrine
it has equally nullified&mdash;I allude to Krishna in his second avatar;
the church, it is true, governs in his name, but not unfrequently gives
him the lie, if he happens to have said anything which it dislikes.&nbsp;
Did you never hear the reply which Padre Paolo Segani made to the French
Protestant Jean Anthoine Guerin, who had asked him whether it was easier
for Christ to have been mistaken in his Gospel, than for the Pope to
be mistaken in his decrees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard their names before,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer was pat,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;though
he who made it was confessedly the most ignorant fellow of the very
ignorant order to which he belonged, the Augustine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Christ
might err as a man,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but the Pope can never err,
being God.&rsquo;&nbsp; The whole story is related in the Nipotismo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you should ever have troubled yourselves with Christ
at all,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was to be done?&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;the
power of that name suddenly came over Europe, like the power of a mighty
wind; it was said to have come from Jud&aelig;a, and from Jud&aelig;a
it probably came when it first began to agitate minds in these parts;
but it seems to have been known in the remote East, more or less, for
thousands of years previously.&nbsp; It filled people&rsquo;s minds
with madness; it was followed by books which were never much regarded,
as they contained little of insanity; but the name! what fury <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>that
breathed into people! the books were about peace and gentleness, but
the name was the most horrible of war-cries&mdash;those who wished to
uphold old names at first strove to oppose it, but their efforts were
feeble, and they had no good war-cry; what was Mars as a war-cry compared
with the name of. . . .?&nbsp; It was said that they persecuted terribly,
but who said so?&nbsp; The Christians.&nbsp; The Christians could have
given them a lesson in the art of persecution, and eventually did so.&nbsp;
None but Christians have ever been good persecutors; well, the old religion
succumbed, Christianity prevailed, for the ferocious is sure to prevail
over the gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you stated a little time
ago that the Popish religion and the ancient Roman are the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In every point but that name, that Krishna and the fury and
love of persecution which it inspired,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A hot blast came from the East, sounding Krishna; it absolutely
maddened people&rsquo;s minds, and the people would call themselves
his children; we will not belong to Jupiter any longer, we will belong
to Krishna; and they did belong to Krishna, that is in name, but in
nothing else; for who ever cared for Krishna in the Christian world,
or who ever regarded the words attributed to Him, or put them in practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we Protestants regard His words, and endeavour to practise
what they enjoin as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you reject his image,&rdquo; said the man in black; <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>&ldquo;better
reject his words than his image: no religion can exist long which rejects
a good bodily image.&nbsp; Why, the very negro barbarians of High Barbary
could give you a lesson on that point; they have their fetish images,
to which they look for help in their afflictions; they have likewise
a high priest, whom they call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumbo Jumbo,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I know all about him already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came you to know anything about him?&rdquo; said the man
in black, with a look of some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us poor Protestant tinkers,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;though
we live in dingles, as also acquainted with a thing or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe you are,&rdquo; said the man in black, staring
at me; &ldquo;but, in connection with this Mumbo Jumbo, I could relate
to you a comical story about a fellow, an English servant, I once met
at Rome.&rdquo; <a name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218">{218}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be quite unnecessary,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I would
much sooner hear you talk about Krishna, his words and image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a true heretic,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;one of the faithful would have placed his image before his words;
for what are all the words in the world compared with a good bodily
image?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you occasionally quote his words?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;upon this rock I will found
my church.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>&ldquo;He!
he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;you must really become one
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you must have had some difficulty in getting the rock
to Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;faith
can remove mountains, to say nothing of rocks&mdash;ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what advantage
you could derive from perverting those words of Scripture in which the
Saviour talks about eating his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, indeed, why we troubled our heads about the
matter at all,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but when you talk
about perverting the meaning of the text, you speak ignorantly, Mr.
Tinker; when he whom you call the Saviour gave his followers the sop,
and bade them eat it, telling them it was his body, he delicately alluded
to what it was incumbent upon them to do after his death, namely, to
eat his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to say that he intended they should actually
eat his body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you suppose ignorantly,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;eating the bodies of the dead was a heathenish custom, practised
by the heirs and legatees of people who left property; and this custom
is alluded to in the text.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has the New Testament to do with heathen customs,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;except to destroy them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you suppose,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We priests of Rome, who have long lived at Rome, know much better
what the New Testament is made of than the heretics and their theologians,
not forgetting their Tinkers; though I confess some of the latter have
<!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>occasionally
surprised us&mdash;for example, Bunyan.&nbsp; The New Testament is crowded
with allusions to heathen customs, and with words connected with pagan
sorcery.&nbsp; Now, with respect to words, I would fain have you, who
pretend to be a philologist, tell me the meaning of Amen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, of Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;know two
or three things of which the heretics are quite ignorant; for example,
there are those amongst us&mdash;those, too, who do not pretend to be
philologists&mdash;who know what amen is, and, moreover, how we got
it.&nbsp; We got it from our ancestors, the priests of ancient Rome;
and they got the word from their ancestors of the East, the priests
of Buddh and Brahma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the meaning of the word?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;is a modification
of the old Hindoo formula, Omani batsikhom, by the almost ceaseless
repetition of which the Indians hope to be received finally to the rest
or state of forgetfulness of Buddh or Brahma; a foolish practice you
will say, but are you heretics much wiser, who are continually sticking
amen to the end of your prayers, little knowing when you do so, that
you are consigning yourselves to the repose of Buddh?&nbsp; Oh, what
hearty laughs our missionaries have had when comparing the eternally
sounding Eastern gibberish of Omani batsikhom, and the Ave Maria and
Amen Jesus of our own idiotical devotees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say about the Ave Marias and <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>Amens
of your superstitious devotees,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I daresay that
they use them nonsensically enough, but in putting Amen to the end of
a prayer, we merely intend to express, &lsquo;So let it be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;and the Hindoos might just as well put your national oath at
the end of their prayers, as perhaps they will after a great many thousand
years, when English is forgotten, and only a few words of it remembered
by dim tradition without being understood.&nbsp; How strange if, after
the lapse of four thousand years, the Hindoos should damn themselves
to the blindness so dear to their present masters, even as their masters
at present consign themselves to the forgetfulness so dear to the Hindoos;
but my glass has been empty for a considerable time; perhaps Bellissima
Biondina,&rdquo; said he, addressing Belle, &ldquo;you will deign to
replenish it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;you have
drank quite enough, and talked more than enough, and to tell you the
truth I wish you would leave us alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on you, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;consider the obligations
of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sick of that word,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;you are
so frequently misusing it; were this place not Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle,
and consequently as free to the fellow as ourselves, I would lead him
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be quiet, Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had
better help yourself,&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to the man in
black, &ldquo;the lady is angry with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;if
she <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>is
angry with me, I am not so with her, and shall always be proud to wait
upon her; in the meantime I will wait upon myself.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.&mdash;THE PROPOSAL&mdash;THE SCOTCH NOVEL&mdash;LATITUDE&mdash;MIRACLES&mdash;PESTILENT
HERETICS&mdash;OLD FRASER&mdash;WONDERFUL TEXT&mdash;NO ARMENIAN.</h2>
<p>The man in black having helped himself to some more of his favourite
beverage, and tasted it, I thus addressed him: &ldquo;The evening is
getting rather advanced, and I can see that this lady,&rdquo; pointing
to Belle, &ldquo;is anxious for her tea, which she prefers to take cosily
and comfortably with me in the dingle.&nbsp; The place, it is true,
is as free to you as to ourselves, nevertheless, as we are located here
by necessity, whilst you merely come as a visitor, I must take the liberty
of telling you that we shall be glad to be alone, as soon as you have
said what you have to say, and have finished the glass of refreshment
at present in your hand.&nbsp; I think you said some time ago that one
of your motives for coming hither was to induce me to enlist under the
banner of Rome.&nbsp; I wish to know whether that was really the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly so,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;I come
here principally in the hope of enlisting you in our regiment, in which
I have no doubt you could do us excellent service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you enlist my companion as well?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p><!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>&ldquo;We
should be only too proud to have her among us, whether she comes with
you or alone,&rdquo; said the man in black, with a polite bow to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we give you an answer,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I would
fain know more about you; perhaps you will declare your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will never do,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;no
one in England knows it but myself, and I will not declare it, even
in a dingle; as for the rest, <i>Sono un Prete Cattolica Appostolico</i>&mdash;that
is all that many a one of us can say for himself, and it assuredly means
a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now proceed to business,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must be aware that we English are generally considered a self-interested
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with considerable justice,&rdquo; said the man in black,
drinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you are a person of acute perception, and
I will presently make it evident to you that it would be to your interest
to join with us.&nbsp; You are at present, evidently, in very needy
circumstances, and are lost, not only to yourself, but the world; but
should you enlist with us, I could find you an occupation not only agreeable,
but one in which your talents would have free scope.&nbsp; I would introduce
you in the various grand houses here in England, to which I have myself
admission, as a surprising young gentleman of infinite learning, who
by dint of study has discovered that the Roman is the only true faith.&nbsp;
I tell you confidently that our popish females would make a saint, nay
a God of you; they are fools enough for anything.&nbsp; There <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>is
one person in particular with whom I should wish to make you acquainted,
in the hope that you would be able to help me to perform good service
to the holy see.&nbsp; He is a gouty old fellow, of some learning, residing
in an old hall, near the great western sea-port, and is one of the very
few amongst the English Catholics possessing a grain of sense.&nbsp;
I think you could help us to govern him, for he is not unfrequently
disposed to be restive, asks us strange questions&mdash;occasionally
threatens us with his crutch; and behaves so that we are often afraid
that we shall lose him, or, rather, his property, which he has bequeathed
to us, and which is enormous.&nbsp; I am sure that you could help us
to deal with him; sometimes with your humour, sometimes with your learning,
and perhaps occasionally with your fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in what manner would you provide for my companion?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would place her at once,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;in the house of two highly respectable Catholic ladies in this
neighbourhood, where she would be treated with every care and consideration
till her conversion should be accomplished in a regular manner; we would
then remove her to a female monastic establishment, where, after undergoing
a year&rsquo;s probation, during which time she would be instructed
in every elegant accomplishment, she should take the veil.&nbsp; Her
advancement would speedily follow, for, with such a face and figure,
she would make a capital lady abbess, especially in Italy, to which
country she would probably be sent; <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>ladies
of her hair and complexion&mdash;to say nothing of her height&mdash;being
a curiosity in the south.&nbsp; With a little care and management she
could soon obtain a vast reputation for sanctity; and who knows but
after her death she might become a glorified saint&mdash;he! he!&nbsp;
Sister Maria Theresa, for that is the name I propose you should bear.&nbsp;
Holy Mother Maria Theresa&mdash;glorified and celestial saint, I have
the honour of drinking to your health,&rdquo; and the man in black drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what have you to say to
the gentleman&rsquo;s proposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if he goes on in this way I will break his glass against
his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the lady&rsquo;s answer,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and shall not
press the matter.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help, however, repeating that
she would make a capital lady abbess; she would keep the nuns in order,
I warrant her; no easy matter!&nbsp; Break the glass against my mouth&mdash;he!
he!&nbsp; How she would send the holy utensils flying at the nuns&rsquo;
heads occasionally, and just the person to wring the nose of Satan should
he venture to appear one night in her cell in the shape of a handsome
black man.&nbsp; No offence, madam, no offence, pray retain your seat,&rdquo;
said he, observing that Belle had started up; &ldquo;I mean no offence.&nbsp;
Well, if you will not consent to be an abbess, perhaps you will consent
to follow this young Zingaro, and to co-operate with him and us.&nbsp;
I am a priest, madam, and can join you both in an instant, <i>connubio
stabili</i>, as I suppose the knot has not been tied already.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>&ldquo;Hold
your mumping gibberish,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and leave the dingle
this moment, for though &rsquo;tis free to every one, you have no right
to insult me in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be pacified,&rdquo; said I to Belle, getting up, and
placing myself between her and the man in black, &ldquo;he will presently
leave, take my word for it&mdash;there, sit down again,&rdquo; said
I, as I led her to her seat; then, resuming my own, I said to the man
in black: &ldquo;I advise you to leave the dingle as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wish to have your answer to my proposal first,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, here you shall have it: I will not entertain your
proposal; I detest your schemes: they are both wicked and foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wicked,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;have they not&mdash;he!
he!&mdash;the furtherance of religion in view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A religion,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in which you yourself do
not believe, and which you contemn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I believe in it or not,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;it is adapted for the generality of the human race; so I will
forward it, and advise you to do the same.&nbsp; It was nearly extirpated
in these regions, but it is springing up again, owing to circumstances.&nbsp;
Radicalism is a good friend to us; all the liberals laud up our system
out of hatred to the Established Church, though our system is ten times
less liberal than the Church of England.&nbsp; Some of them have really
come over to us.&nbsp; I myself confess a baronet [Sir Charles Wolesley]
who presided over the first <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>radical
meeting ever held in England&mdash;he was an atheist when he came over
to us, in the hope of mortifying his own church&mdash;but he is now&mdash;ho!
ho!&mdash;a real Catholic devotee&mdash;quite afraid of my threats;
I made him frequently scourge himself before me.&nbsp; Well, Radicalism
does us good service, especially amongst the lower classes, for Radicalism
chiefly flourishes amongst them; for though a baronet or two may be
found amongst the radicals, and perhaps as many lords&mdash;fellows
who have been discarded by their own order for clownishness, or something
they have done&mdash;it incontestably flourishes best among the lower
orders.&nbsp; Then the love of what is foreign is a great friend to
us; this love is chiefly confined to the middle and upper classes. <a name="citation227"></a><a href="#footnote227">{227}</a>&nbsp;
Some admire the French, and imitate them; others must needs be Spaniards,
dress themselves up in a zamarra, stick a cigar in their mouths, and
say, &lsquo;Carajo.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others would pass for Germans; he!
he! the idea of any one wishing to pass for a German! but what has done
us more service than anything else in these regions&mdash;I mean amidst
the middle classes&mdash;has been the novel, the Scotch novel.&nbsp;
The good folks, since they have read the novels, have become Jacobites;
and, because all the Jacobs were Papists, the good folks must become
Papists also, or, at least, papistically inclined.&nbsp; The very Scotch
Presbyterians, since they have read the <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>novels,
are become all but Papists; I speak advisedly, having lately been amongst
them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a trumpery bit of a half papist sect, called
the Scotch Episcopalian Church, which lay dormant and nearly forgotten
for upwards of a hundred years, which has of late got wonderfully into
fashion in Scotland, because, forsooth, some of the long-haired gentry
of the novels were said to belong to it, such as Montrose and Dundee;
and to this the Presbyterians are going over in throngs, traducing and
vilifying their own forefathers, or denying them altogether, and calling
themselves descendants of&mdash;ho! ho! ho!&mdash;Scottish Cavaliers!!!&nbsp;
I have heard them myself repeating snatches of Jacobite ditties about
&lsquo;Bonnie Dundee,&rsquo; and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come, fill up my cup, and fill up my can,<br />
And saddle my horse, and call up my man.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff for you!&nbsp; Not that I object to the first
part of the ditty, it is natural enough that a Scotchman should cry,
&lsquo;Come, fill up my cup!&rsquo; more especially if he&rsquo;s drinking
at another person&rsquo;s expense&mdash;all Scotchmen being fond of
liquor at free cost: but &lsquo;Saddle his horse!!!&rsquo;&mdash;for
what purpose I would ask?&nbsp; Where is the use of saddling a horse,
unless you can ride him? and where was there ever a Scotchman who could
ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have not a drop of Scotch blood in your veins,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;otherwise you would never have uttered that last sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; said the man in black;
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>&ldquo;you
know little of Popery if you imagine that it cannot extinguish love
of country, even in a Scotchman.&nbsp; A thorough-going Papist&mdash;and
who more thorough-going than myself&mdash;cares nothing for his country;
and why should he? he belongs to a system, and not to a country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;connected with you, I cannot
understand; you call yourself a thorough-going Papist, yet are continually
saying the most pungent things against Popery, and turning to unbounded
ridicule those who show any inclination to embrace it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rome is a very sensible old body,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;and little cares what her children say, provided they do her
bidding.&nbsp; She knows several things, and amongst others, that no
servants work so hard and faithfully as those who curse their masters
at every stroke they do.&nbsp; She was not fool enough to be angry with
the Miquelets of Alba, who renounced her, and called her &lsquo;puta&rsquo;
all the time they were cutting the throats of the Netherlanders.&nbsp;
Now, if she allowed her faithful soldiers the latitude of renouncing
her, and calling her &lsquo;puta&rsquo; in the market-place, think not
she is so unreasonable as to object to her faithful priests occasionally
calling her &lsquo;puta&rsquo; in the dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;suppose some one were to tell the
world some of the disorderly things which her priests say in the dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have the fate of Cassandra,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;no one would believe him&mdash;yes, the priests would:
but they would make no sign of belief.&nbsp; <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>They
believe in the Alcoran des Cordeliers <a name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230">{230}</a>&mdash;that
is, those who have read it; but they make no sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty system,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which extinguishes
love of country and of everything noble, and brings the minds of its
ministers to a parity with those of devils, who delight in nothing but
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The system,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;is a grand
one, with unbounded vitality.&nbsp; Compare it with your Protestantism,
and you will see the difference.&nbsp; Popery is ever at work, whilst
Protestantism is supine.&nbsp; A pretty church, indeed, the Protestant!&nbsp;
Why, it can&rsquo;t even work a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can your church work miracles?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the very question,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;which the ancient British clergy asked of Austin Monk, after
they had been fools enough to acknowledge their own inability.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t pretend to work miracles; do you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh! dear me, yes,&rsquo; said Austin; &lsquo;we find no difficulty
in the matter.&nbsp; We can raise the dead, we can make the blind see;
and to convince you I will give sight to the blind.&nbsp; Here is this
blind Saxon, whom you cannot cure, but on whose eyes I will manifest
my power, in order to show the difference between the true and the false
church;&rsquo; and forthwith, with the assistance of a handkerchief
and a little hot water, he opened the eyes of the barbarian.&nbsp; So
we manage matters!&nbsp; A pretty church, that old British church, which
could not work miracles&mdash;quite as helpless as the modern one.&nbsp;
The <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>fools!
was birdlime so scarce a thing amongst them?&mdash;and were the properties
of warm water so unknown to them, that they could not close a pair of
eyes and open them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the British
clergy, at that interview with Austin, did not bring forward a blind
Welshman, and ask the monk to operate upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
what they ought to have done; but they were fools without a single resource.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he took a sip at his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they did not believe in the miracle?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did their not believing avail them?&rdquo; said the
man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;Austin remained master of the field, and
they went away holding their heads down, and muttering to themselves.&nbsp;
What a fine subject for a painting would be Austin&rsquo;s opening the
eyes of the Saxon barbarian, and the discomfiture of the British clergy!&nbsp;
I wonder it has not been painted!&mdash;he! he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your church still pet forms miracles occasionally?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Rev.
. . . has lately been performing miracles in Ireland, destroying devils
that had got possession of people; he has been eminently successful.&nbsp;
In two instances he not only destroyed the devils, but the lives of
the people possessed&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; Oh! there is so much energy
in our system; we are always at work, whilst Protestantism is supine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that all Protestants
are supine; some of them appear to be filled with unbounded zeal.&nbsp;
They deal, it is true, not in lying <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>miracles,
but they propagate God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; I remember only a few months
ago, having occasion for a Bible, going to an establishment, the object
of which was to send Bibles all over the world.&nbsp; The supporters
of that establishment could have no self-interested views; for I was
supplied by them with a noble-sized Bible at a price so small as to
preclude the idea that it could bring any profit to the vendors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countenance of the man in black slightly fell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know the people to whom you allude,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;indeed, unknown
to them, I have frequently been to see them, and observed their ways.&nbsp;
I tell you frankly that there is not a set of people in this kingdom
who have caused our church so much trouble and uneasiness.&nbsp; I should
rather say that they alone cause us any; for as for the rest, what with
their drowsiness, their plethora, their folly, and their vanity, they
are doing us anything but mischief.&nbsp; These fellows are a pestilent
set of heretics, whom we would gladly see burnt; they are, with the
most untiring perseverance, and in spite of divers minatory declarations
of the holy father, scattering their books abroad through all Europe,
and have caused many people in Catholic countries to think that hitherto
their priesthood have endeavoured, as much as possible, to keep them
blinded.&nbsp; There is one fellow amongst them for whom we entertain
a particular aversion; a big, burly parson, with the face of a lion,
the voice of a buffalo, and a fist like a sledge-hammer.&nbsp; The last
time I was there, I observed that his eye was upon me, and I did not
like the glance he gave me <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>at
all; I observed him clench his fist, and I took my departure as fast
as I conveniently could.&nbsp; Whether he suspected who I was, I know
not; but I did not like his look at all, and do not intend to go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you confess that you have
redoubtable enemies to your plans in these regions, and that even amongst
the ecclesiastics there are some widely different from those of the
plethoric and Platitude schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but too true,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;and
if the rest of your church were like them we should quickly bid adieu
to all hope of converting these regions, but we are thankful to be able
to say that such folks are not numerous; there are, moreover, causes
at work quite sufficient to undermine even their zeal.&nbsp; Their sons
return at the vacations, from Oxford and Cambridge, puppies, full of
the nonsense which they have imbibed from Platitude professors; and
this nonsense they retail at home, where it fails not to make some impression,
whilst the daughters scream&mdash;I beg their pardons&mdash;warble about
Scotland&rsquo;s Montrose, and Bonny Dundee, and all the Jacobs; so
we have no doubt that their papa&rsquo;s zeal about the propagation
of such a vulgar book as the Bible will in a very little time be terribly
diminished.&nbsp; Old Rome will win, so you had better join her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man in black drained the last drop in his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will I become the slave of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will allow you latitude,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;do but serve her, and she will allow you to call her &lsquo;puta&rsquo;
at a decent time and place, her popes occasionally <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>call
her &lsquo;puta.&rsquo;&nbsp; A pope has been known to start from his
bed at midnight and rush out into the corridor, and call out &lsquo;puta&rsquo;
three times in a voice which pierced the Vatican; that pope was . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander the Sixth, I dare say,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the
greatest monster that ever existed, though the worthiest head which
the popish system ever had&mdash;so his conscience was not always still.&nbsp;
I thought it had been seared with a brand of iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not allude to him, but to a much more modern pope,&rdquo;
said the man in black; &ldquo;it is true he brought the word, which
is Spanish, from Spain, his native country, to Rome.&nbsp; He was very
fond of calling the church by that name, and other popes have taken
it up.&nbsp; She will allow you to call her by it if you belong to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call her so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;without belonging
to her, or asking her permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will allow you to treat her as such if you belong to her,&rdquo;
said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a chapel in Rome, where
there is a wondrously fair statue&mdash;the son of a cardinal&mdash;I
mean his nephew&mdash;once . . .&nbsp; Well, she did not cut off his
head, but slightly boxed his cheek and bade him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read all about that in &lsquo;Keysler&rsquo;s Travels,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;do you tell her that I would not touch her with a pair
of tongs, unless to seize her nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is fond of lucre,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but
does not grudge a faithful priest a little private perquisite,&rdquo;
and he took out a very handsome gold repeater.</p>
<p><!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>&ldquo;Are
you not afraid,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to flash that watch before the
eyes of a poor tinker in a dingle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before the eyes of one like you,&rdquo; said the man in
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I care not for perquisites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you will not join us?&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had my answer,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I belong to Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;why
should not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be a poor tinker,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I may never
have undergone what you have.&nbsp; You remember, perhaps, the fable
of the fox who had lost his tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black winced, but almost immediately recovering himself,
he said, &ldquo;Well, we can do without you: we are sure of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the part of wise people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to
make sure of the battle before it is fought: there&rsquo;s the landlord
of the public-house, who made sure that his cocks would win, yet the
cocks lost the main, and the landlord is little better than a bankrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People very different from the landlord,&rdquo; said the man
in black, &ldquo;both in intellect and station, think we shall surely
win; there are clever machinators among us who have no doubt of our
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will set the landlord aside,
and will adduce one who was in every point a very different person from
the landlord, both in understanding and station; he was very fond of
laying schemes, and, indeed, many of them turned out successful.&nbsp;
His last <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>and
darling one, however, miscarried, notwithstanding that by his calculations
he had persuaded himself that there was no possibility of its failing&mdash;the
person that I allude to was old Fraser . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said the man in black, giving a start, and letting
his glass fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Fraser, of Lovat,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the prince of
all conspirators and machinators; he made sure of placing the Pretender
on the throne of these realms.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can bring into the field
so many men,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;my son-in-law, Cluny, so many, and
likewise my cousin, and my good friend;&rsquo; then speaking of those
on whom the government reckoned for support he would say, &lsquo;So-and-so
is lukewarm; this person is ruled by his wife, who is with us; the clergy
are anything but hostile to us; and as for the soldiers and sailors,
half are disaffected to King George, and the rest cowards.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Yet when things came to a trial, this person whom he had calculated
upon to join the Pretender did not stir from his home, another joined
the hostile ranks, the presumed cowards turned out heroes, and those
whom he thought heroes ran away like lusty fellows at Culloden; in a
word, he found himself utterly mistaken, and in nothing more than himself;
he thought he was a hero, and proved himself nothing more than an old
fox; he got up a hollow tree, didn&rsquo;t he, just like a fox?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;L&rsquo; opere sue non furon leonine, ma
di volpe.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation237"></a><a href="#footnote237">{237}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man in black sat silent for a considerable time, <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>and
at length answered, in rather a faltering voice, &ldquo;I was not prepared
for this; you have frequently surprised me by your knowledge of things
which I should never have expected any person of your appearance to
be acquainted with, but that you should be aware of my name is a circumstance
utterly incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; I had imagined that no person
in England was acquainted with it; indeed, I don&rsquo;t see how any
person should be, I have revealed it to no one, not being particularly
proud of it.&nbsp; Yes, I acknowledge that my name is Fraser, and that
I am of the blood of that family or clan, of which the rector of our
college once said that he was firmly of opinion that every individual
member was either rogue or fool.&nbsp; I was born at Madrid, of pure,
<i>oim&egrave;</i>, Fraser blood.&nbsp; My parents at an early age took
me to [Rome], where they shortly died, not, however, before they had
placed me in the service of a cardinal, with whom I continued some years,
and who, when he had no further occasion for me, sent me to the college,
in the left-hand cloister of which, as you enter, rest the bones of
Sir John D[ereham]; there, in studying logic and humane letters, I lost
whatever of humanity I had retained when discarded by the cardinal.&nbsp;
Let me not, however, forget two points,&mdash;I am a Fraser, it is true,
but not a Flannagan; I may bear the vilest name of Britain, but not
of Ireland; I was bred up at the English house, and there is at [Rome]
a house for the education of bog-trotters; I was not bred up at that;
beneath the lowest gulf, there is one yet lower; whatever my blood may
be, it is <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>at
least not Irish; whatever my education may have been, I was not bred
at the Irish seminary&mdash;on those accounts I am thankful&mdash;yes,
<i>per dio</i>!&nbsp; I am thankful.&nbsp; After some years at college&mdash;but
why should I tell you my history, you know it already perfectly well,
probably much better than myself.&nbsp; I am now a missionary priest
labouring in heretic England, like Parsons and Garnet of old, save and
except that, unlike them, I run no danger, for the times are changed.&nbsp;
As I told you before, I shall cleave to Rome&mdash;I must; <i>no hay
remedio</i>, as they say at Madrid, and I will do my best to further
her holy plans&mdash;he! he!&mdash;but I confess I begin to doubt of
their being successful here&mdash;you put me out; old Fraser, of Lovat!&nbsp;
I have heard my father talk of him; he had a gold-headed cane, with
which he once knocked my grandfather down&mdash;he was an astute one,
but as you say, mistaken, particularly in himself.&nbsp; I have read
his life by Arbuthnot, <a name="citation238a"></a><a href="#footnote238a">{238a}</a>
it is in the library of our college.&nbsp; Farewell!&nbsp; I shall come
no more to this dingle&mdash;to come would be of no utility; I shall
go and labour elsewhere, though . . . how you came to know my name is
a fact quite inexplicable&mdash;farewell! to you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then arose; and without further salutation departed from the dingle,
in which I never saw him again. <a name="citation238b"></a><a href="#footnote238b">{238b}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;How, in the name of wonder, came you to know <!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>that
man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; said Belle, after he had been gone some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Belle?&nbsp; I knew nothing of the fellow&rsquo;s name,
I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mentioned his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, it was merely casually, by way of illustration.&nbsp;
I was saying how frequently cunning people were mistaken in their calculations,
and I adduced the case of old Fraser, of Lovat, as one in point; I brought
forward his name, because I was well-acquainted with his history, from
having compiled and inserted it in a wonderful work, which I edited
some months ago, entitled &lsquo;Newgate Lives and Trials,&rsquo; but
without the slightest idea that it was the name of him who was sitting
with us; he, however, thought that I was aware of his name.&nbsp; Belle!
Belle! for a long time I doubted the truth of Scripture, owing to certain
conceited individuals, but now I begin to believe firmly; what wonderful
texts are in Scripture, Belle!&nbsp; &lsquo;The wicked trembleth where&mdash;where
. . .&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They were afraid where no fear was; thou hast put them
to confusion, because God hath despised them,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;I have frequently read it before the clergyman in the great house
of Long Melford.&nbsp; But if you did not know the man&rsquo;s name,
why let him go away supposing that you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he was fool enough to make such a mistake, I was not
going to undeceive him&mdash;no, no!&nbsp; Let the enemies of old England
make the most of all their blunders and mistakes, they will have no
help from me; <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>but
enough of the fellow, Belle, let us now have tea, and after that . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Armenian,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but I want to ask a
question: pray are all people of that man&rsquo;s name either rogues
or fools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to say, Belle, this person being the
only one of the name I have ever personally known.&nbsp; I suppose there
are good and bad, clever and foolish, amongst them, as amongst all large
bodies of people; however, after the tribe had been governed for upwards
of thirty years by such a person as old Fraser, it were no wonder if
the greater part had become either rogues or fools: he was a ruthless
tyrant, Belle, over his own people, and by his cruelty and rapaciousness
must either have stunned them into an apathy approaching to idiocy,
or made them artful knaves in their own defence.&nbsp; The qualities
of parents are generally transmitted to their descendants&mdash;the
progeny of trained pointers are almost sure to point, even without being
taught: if, therefore, all Frasers are either rogues or fools, as this
person seems to insinuate, it is little to be wondered at, their parents
or grandparents having been in the training-school of old Fraser! but
enough of the old tyrant and his slaves.&nbsp; Belle, prepare tea this
moment, or dread my anger.&nbsp; I have not a gold-headed cane like
old Fraser of Lovat, but I have, what some people would dread much more,
an Armenian rune-stick.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>CHAPTER
XXI.&mdash;FRESH ARRIVALS&mdash;PITCHING THE TENT&mdash;CERTIFICATED
WIFE&mdash;HIGH-FLYING NOTIONS.</h2>
<p>On the following morning, as I was about to leave my tent, I heard
the voice of Belle at the door, exclaiming, &ldquo;Sleepest thou, or
wakest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was never more awake in my life,&rdquo;
said I, going out, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He
of the horse-shoe,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Jasper, of whom I have heard
you talk, is above there on the field with all his people; I went about
a quarter of an hour ago to fill the kettle at the spring, and saw them
arriving.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have
you any objection to asking him and his wife to breakfast?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can do as you please,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have cups
enough, and have no objection to their company.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are the first occupiers of the ground,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and, being
so, should consider ourselves in the light of hosts, and do our best
to practise the duties of hospitality.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How fond
you are of using that word!&rdquo; said Belle: &ldquo;if you wish to
invite the man and his wife, do so, without more ado; remember, however,
that I have not cups enough, nor indeed tea enough, for the whole company.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon hurrying up the ascent, I presently found myself outside the
dingle.&nbsp; It was as usual a brilliant morning, the dewy blades of
the rye-grass which covered the plain sparkled brightly in the beams
of the sun, which had probably been about two hours above the horizon.&nbsp;
A rather numerous body of my ancient friends and allies occupied <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the
ground in the vicinity of the mouth of the dingle.&nbsp; About five
yards on the right I perceived Mr. Petulengro busily employed in erecting
his tent; he held in his hand an iron bar, sharp at the bottom, with
a kind of arm projecting from the top for the purpose of supporting
a kettle or cauldron over the fire, and which is called in the Romanian
language &ldquo;Kekauviskoe saster.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the sharp end
of this Mr. Petulengro was making holes in the earth at about twenty
inches&rsquo; distance from each other, into which he inserted certain
long rods with a considerable bend towards the top, which constituted
no less than the timbers of the tent, and the supporters of the canvas.&nbsp;
Mrs. Petulengro and a female with a crutch in her hand, whom I recognised
as Mrs. Chikno, sat near him on the ground, whilst two or three children,
from six to ten years old, who composed the young family of Mr. and
Mrs. Petulengro, were playing about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, as he drove
the sharp end of the bar into the ground; &ldquo;here we are, and plenty
of us&mdash;Bute dosta Romany chals.&rdquo; <a name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242">{242}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you all,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and particularly
you, madam,&rdquo; said I, making a bow to Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;and
you also, madam,&rdquo; taking off my hat to Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day to you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;you
look as usual, charmingly, and speak so, too; you have not forgot your
manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not all gold that glitters,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However, good-morrow to you, young rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>&ldquo;I
do not see Tawno,&rdquo; said I, looking around; &ldquo;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know; he who countenances him in the roving line can best answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here anon,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;he
has merely ridden down a by-road to show a farmer a two-year-old colt;
she heard me give him directions, but she can&rsquo;t be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I place no confidence in your words, brother; as I
said before, you countenances him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know nothing of your private
concerns; I am come on an errand.&nbsp; Isopel Berners, down in the
dell there, requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro&rsquo;s
company at breakfast.&nbsp; She will be happy also to see you, madam,&rdquo;
said I, addressing Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that young female your wife, young man?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, young man, your wife, your lawful certificated wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she is not my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will not visit with her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno; &ldquo;I
countenance nothing in the roving line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by the roving line?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I mean by the roving line?&nbsp; Why, by it <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>I
mean such conduct as is no ttatcheno. <a name="citation244a"></a><a href="#footnote244a">{244a}</a>&nbsp;
When ryes and rawnies <a name="citation244b"></a><a href="#footnote244b">{244b}</a>
lives together in dingles, without being certificated, I calls such
behaviour being tolerably deep in the roving line, everything savouring
of which I am determined not to sanctify.&nbsp; I have suffered too
much by my own certificated husband&rsquo;s outbreaks in that line to
afford anything of the kind the slightest shadow of countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard that people may not live in dingles together without
being suspected of doing wrong,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, interposing; &ldquo;and,
to tell you the truth, I am altogether surprised at the illiberality
of my sister&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; I have often heard say, that is
in good company&mdash;and I have kept good company in my time&mdash;that
suspicion is king&rsquo;s evidence of a narrow and uncultivated mind;
on which account I am suspicious of nobody, not even of my own husband,
whom some people would think I have a right to be suspicious of, seeing
that on his account I once refused a lord; but ask him whether I am
suspicious of him, and whether I seek to keep him close tied to my apron-string;
he will tell you nothing of the kind; but that, on the contrary, I always
allows him an agreeable latitude, permitting him to go where he pleases,
and to converse with any one to whose manner of speaking he may take
a fancy.&nbsp; But I have had the advantage of keeping good company,
and therefore . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meklis,&rdquo; <a name="citation244c"></a><a href="#footnote244c">{244c}</a>
said Mrs. Chikno, &ldquo;pray drop all that, <!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>sister;
I believe I have kept as good company as yourself; and with respect
to that offer with which you frequently fatigue those who keeps company
with you, I believe, after all, it was something in the roving and uncertificated
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In whatever line it was,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;the
offer was a good one.&nbsp; The young duke&mdash;for he was not only
a lord, but a duke too&mdash;offered to keep me a fine carriage, and
to make me his second wife; for it is true that he had another who was
old and stout, though mighty rich, and highly good-natured; so much
so, indeed, that the young lord assured me that she would have no manner
of objection to the arrangement; more especially if I would consent
to live in the same house with her, being fond of young and cheerful
society.&nbsp; So you see . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno, &ldquo;I see, what I before
thought, that it was altogether in the uncertificated line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meklis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;I use your own
word, madam, which is Romany; for my own part, I am not fond of using
Romany words, unless I can hope to pass them off for French, which I
cannot in the present company.&nbsp; I heartily wish that there was
no such language, and do my best to keep it away from my children, lest
the frequent use of it should altogether confirm them in low and vulgar
habits.&nbsp; I have four children, madam, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose by talking of your four children you wish to check
me for having none,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno, <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>bursting
into tears; &ldquo;if I have no children, sister, it is no fault of
mine, it is&mdash;but why do I call you sister,&rdquo; said she angrily,
&ldquo;you are no sister of mine, you are a grasni, a regular mare&mdash;a
pretty sister, indeed, ashamed of your own language.&nbsp; I remember
well that by your high-flying notions you drove your own mother . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will drop it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;I do
not wish to raise my voice, and to make myself ridiculous.&nbsp; Young
gentleman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;pray present my compliments to Miss
Isopel Berners, and inform her that I am very sorry that I cannot accept
her polite invitation.&nbsp; I am just arrived, and have some slight
domestic matters to see to, amongst others, to wash my children&rsquo;s
faces; but that in the course of the forenoon, when I have attended
to what I have to do, and have dressed myself, I hope to do myself the
honour of paying her a regular visit; you will tell her that with my
compliments.&nbsp; With respect to my husband he can answer for himself,
as I, not being of a jealous disposition, never interferes with his
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell Miss Berners,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;that
I shall be happy to wait upon her in company with my wife as soon as
we are regularly settled; at present I have much on my hands, having
not only to pitch my own tent, but this here jealous woman&rsquo;s,
whose husband is absent on my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I returned to the dingle, and without saying anything about
Mrs. Chikno&rsquo;s observations, communicated to Isopel the messages
of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro; Isopel made no other reply than by replacing
<!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>in
her coffer two additional cups and saucers, which, in expectation of
company, she had placed upon the board.&nbsp; The kettle was by this
time boiling.&nbsp; We sat down, and as we breakfasted, I gave Isopel
Berners another lesson in the Armenian language.</p>

AND WITCH&mdash;CATCHING AT WORDS&mdash;THE TWO FEMALES&mdash;DRESSING
OF HAIR&mdash;THE NEW ROADS&mdash;BELLE&rsquo;S ALTERED APPEARANCE&mdash;HERSELF
AGAIN.</h2>
<p>About mid-day Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro <a name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247">{247}</a>
came to the dingle to pay the promised visit.&nbsp; Belle, at the time
of their arrival, was in her tent, but I was at the fireplace, engaged
in hammering part of the outer-tire, or defence, which had come off
from one of the wheels of my vehicle.&nbsp; On perceiving them I forthwith
went to receive them.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro was dressed in Roman fashion,
<!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>with
a somewhat smartly-cut sporting-coat, the buttons of which were half-crowns&mdash;and
a waistcoat, scarlet and black, the buttons of which were spaded half-guineas;
his breeches were of a stuff half velveteen, half corduroy, the cords
exceedingly broad.&nbsp; He had leggings of buff cloth, furred at the
bottom: and upon his feet were highlows.&nbsp; Under his left arm was
a long black whalebone riding-whip, with a red lash, and an immense
silver knob.&nbsp; Upon his head was a hat with a high peak, somewhat
of the kind which the Spaniards call <i>calan&eacute;</i>, so much in
favour with the bravos of Seville and Madrid.&nbsp; Now when I have
added that Mr. Petulengro had on a very fine white holland shirt, I
think I have described his array.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro&mdash;I beg
pardon for not having spoken of her first&mdash;was also arrayed very
much in the Roman fashion.&nbsp; Her hair, which was exceedingly black
and lustrous, fell in braids on either side of her head.&nbsp; <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>In
her ears were rings, with long drops of gold.&nbsp; Round her neck was
a string of what seemed very much like very large pearls, somewhat tarnished,
however, and apparently of considerable antiquity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
we are, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;here we are, come
to see you&mdash;wizard and witch, witch and wizard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a chovahanee, and a chovahano,
<a name="citation249a"></a><a href="#footnote249a">{249a}</a><br />
The nav se len is Petulengro.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;you
make me ashamed of you with your vulgar ditties.&nbsp; We are come a-visiting
now, and everything low should be left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;why bring what&rsquo;s
low to the dingle, which is low enough already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are you a catcher at words?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought that catching at words had been confined to the pothouse farmers
and village witty bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All fools,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;catch at words,
and very naturally, as by so doing they hope to prevent the possibility
of rational conversation.&nbsp; Catching at words confined to pothouse
farmers and village witty bodies!&nbsp; No, nor to Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp;
Listen for an hour or two to the discourse of a set they call newspaper
editors, and if you don&rsquo;t go out and eat grass, as a dog does
when he is sick, I am no female woman.&nbsp; The young lord whose hand
I refused when I took up with wise Jasper once brought two of them to
my mother&rsquo;s tan, <a name="citation249b"></a><a href="#footnote249b">{249b}</a>
when hankering after my <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>company;
they did nothing but carp at each other&rsquo;s words, and a pretty
hand they made of it.&nbsp; Ill-favoured dogs they were, and their attempt
at what they called wit almost as unfortunate as their countenances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;madam, we will drop all catchings
and carpings for the present.&nbsp; Pray take your seat on this stool,
whilst I go and announce to Miss Isopel Berners your arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I went to Belle&rsquo;s habitation, and informed her that
Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro had paid us a visit of ceremony, and were awaiting
her at the fireplace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray go and tell them that I am busy,&rdquo;
said Belle, who was engaged with her needle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not feel
disposed to take part in any such nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
do no such thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I insist upon your coming
forthwith, and showing proper courtesy to your visitors.&nbsp; If you
do not their feelings will be hurt, and you are aware that I cannot
bear that people&rsquo;s feelings should be outraged.&nbsp; Come this
moment, or . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; said Belle, half
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was about to say something in Armenian,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Belle, laying down her work,
&ldquo;I will come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your
hair is hanging about your ears, and your dress is in disorder; you
had better stay a minute or two to prepare yourself to appear before
your visitors, who have come in their very best attire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I will make no alteration in my
appearance; you told me to come this moment, and you shall be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Belle and I advanced towards our guests.&nbsp; As <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>we
drew nigh Mr. Petulengro took off his hat and made a profound obeisance
to Belle, whilst Mrs. Petulengro rose from the stool and made a profound
curtsey.&nbsp; Belle, who had flung her hair back over her shoulders,
returned their salutations by bending her head, and after slightly glancing
at Mr. Petulengro, fixed her large blue eyes full upon his wife.&nbsp;
Both these females were very handsome&mdash;but how unlike!&nbsp; Belle
fair, with blue eyes and flaxen hair; Mrs. Petulengro with olive complexion,
eyes black, and hair dark&mdash;as dark as could be.&nbsp; Belle, in
demeanour calm and proud; the gypsy graceful, but full of movement and
agitation.&nbsp; And then how different were those two in stature!&nbsp;
The head of the Romany rawnie scarcely ascended to the breast of Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; I could see that Mrs. Petulengro gazed on Belle with
unmixed admiration: so did her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
the latter, &ldquo;one thing I will say, which is, that there is only
one on earth worthy to stand up in front of this she, and that is the
beauty of the world, as far as man flesh is concerned, Tawno Chikno;
what a pity he did not come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawno Chikno,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, flaring up; &ldquo;a
pretty fellow he to stand up in front of this gentlewoman, a pity he
didn&rsquo;t come, quotha? not at all, the fellow is a sneak, afraid
of his wife.&nbsp; He stand up against this rawnie! why the look she
has given me would knock the fellow down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easier to knock him down with a look than with a fist,&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that is, if the <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>look
comes from a woman: not that I am disposed to doubt that this female
gentlewoman is able to knock him down either one way or the other.&nbsp;
I have heard of her often enough, and have seen her once or twice, though
not so near as now.&nbsp; Well, ma&rsquo;am, my wife and I are come
to pay our respects to you; we are both glad to find that you have left
off keeping company with Flaming Bosville, and have taken up with my
pal; he is not very handsome, but a better . . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take up with your pal, as you call him; you had better mind
what you say,&rdquo; said Isopel Berners; &ldquo;I take up with nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely mean taking up your quarters with him,&rdquo; said
Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;and I was only about to say a better fellow-lodger
you cannot have, or a more instructive, especially if you have a desire
to be inoculated with tongues, as he calls them.&nbsp; I wonder whether
you and he have had any tongue-work already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you and your wife anything particular to say?&nbsp; If
you have nothing but this kind of conversation I must leave you, as
I am going to make a journey this afternoon, and should be getting ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse my husband, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro;
&ldquo;he is not overburdened with understanding, and has said but one
word of sense since he has been here, which was that we came to pay
our respects to you.&nbsp; We have dressed ourselves in our best Roman
way, in order to do honour to you; perhaps you do not like it; if so,
I am sorry.&nbsp; I have no French clothes, madam; if I had any, madam,
<!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>I
would have come in them in order to do you more honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to see you much better as you are,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;people should keep to their own fashions, and yours is very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are pleased to think it so, madam; it has been
admired in the great city, it created what they call a sensation, and
some of the great ladies, the court ladies, imitated it, else I should
not appear in it so often as I am accustomed; for I am not very fond
of what is Roman, having an imagination that what is Roman is ungenteel;
in fact, I once heard the wife of a rich citizen say that gypsies were
vulgar creatures.&nbsp; I should have taken her saying very much to
heart, but for her improper pronunciation; she could not pronounce her
words, madam, which we gypsies, as they call us, usually can, so I thought
she was no very high purchase.&nbsp; You are very beautiful, madam,
though you are not dressed as I could wish to see you, and your hair
is hanging down in sad confusion; allow me to assist you in arranging
your hair, madam; I will dress it for you in our fashion; I would fain
see how your hair would look in our poor gypsy fashion; pray allow me,
madam?&rdquo; and she took Belle by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can do no such thing,&rdquo; said Belle, withdrawing
her hand; &ldquo;I thank you for coming to see me, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do allow me to officiate upon your hair, madam,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;I should esteem your allowing <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>me
a great mark of condescension.&nbsp; You are very beautiful, madam,
and I think you doubly so, because you are so fair; I have a great esteem
for persons with fair complexions and hair; I have a less regard for
people with dark hair and complexions, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you turn off the lord, and take up with me?&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that same lord was fair enough all about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People do when they are young and silly what they sometimes
repent of when they are of riper years and understandings.&nbsp; I sometimes
think that had I not been something of a simpleton, I might at this
time be a great court lady.&nbsp; Now, madam,&rdquo; said she, again
taking Belle by the hand, &ldquo;do oblige me by allowing me to plait
your hair a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have really a good mind to be angry with you,&rdquo; said
Belle, giving Mrs. Petulengro a peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do allow her to arrange your hair,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she
means no harm, and wishes to do you honour; do oblige her and me too,
for I should like to see how your hair would look dressed in her fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear what the young rye says?&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sure you will oblige the young rye, if not myself.&nbsp;
Many people would be willing to oblige the young rye, if he would but
ask them; but he is not in the habit of asking favours.&nbsp; He has
a nose of his own, which he keeps tolerably exalted; he does not think
small-beer of himself, madam; and all the time I have been with him,
I never heard him ask a favour before; therefore, madam, I am sure you
<!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>will
oblige him.&nbsp; My sister Ursula would be very willing to oblige him
in many things, but he will not ask for anything, except for such a
favour as a word, which is a poor favour after all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
mean for her word; perhaps he will some day ask you for your word.&nbsp;
If so . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why here you are, after railing at me for catching at words,
catching at a word yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me in my discourse; if I caught at a word
now, I am not in the habit of doing so.&nbsp; I am no conceited body;
no newspaper Neddy; no pothouse witty person.&nbsp; I was about to say,
madam, that if the young rye asks you at any time for your word, you
will do as you deem convenient; but I am sure you will oblige him by
allowing me to braid your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not do it to oblige him,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;the
young rye, as you call him, is nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, to oblige me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;do
allow me to become your poor tire-woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is great nonsense,&rdquo; said Belle, reddening; &ldquo;however,
as you came to see me, and ask the matter as a particular favour to
yourself . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, leading Belle
to the stool; &ldquo;please to sit down here.&nbsp; Thank you; your
hair is very beautiful, madam,&rdquo; she continued as she proceeded
to braid Belle&rsquo;s hair; &ldquo;so is your countenance.&nbsp; Should
you ever go to the great city, among the grand folks, you would make
a sensation, madam.&nbsp; I have made one myself, who am dark; the <!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>chi
she is kauley, which last word signifies black, which I am not, though
rather dark.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no colour like white, madam; it&rsquo;s
so lasting, so genteel.&nbsp; Gentility will carry the day, madam, even
with the young rye.&nbsp; He will ask words of the black lass, but beg
the word of the fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. Petulengro and myself entered into conversation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Any news stirring, Mr. Petulengro?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
you heard anything of the great religious movements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;all the religious
people, more especially the Evangelicals&mdash;those that go about distributing
tracts&mdash;are very angry about the fight between Gentleman Cooper
and White-headed Bob, which they say ought not to have been permitted
to take place; and then they are trying all they can to prevent the
fight between the lion and the dogs, <a name="citation256"></a><a href="#footnote256">{256}</a>
which they say is a disgrace to a Christian country.&nbsp; Now, I can&rsquo;t
say that I have any quarrel with the religious party and the Evangelicals;
they are always civil to me and mine, and frequently give us tracts,
as they call them, which neither I nor mine can read; but I cannot say
that I approve of any movements, religious or not, which have in aim
to put down all life and manly sport in this here country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>&ldquo;People
are becoming vastly sharp,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;and I
am told that all the old-fashioned, good-tempered constables are going
to be set aside, and a paid body of men to be established, <a name="citation257"></a><a href="#footnote257">{257}</a>
who are not to permit a tramper or vagabond on the roads of England;&mdash;and
talking of roads puts me in mind of a strange story I heard two nights
ago, whilst drinking some beer at a public-house, in company with my
cousin Sylvester.&nbsp; I had asked Tawno to go, but his wife would
not let him.&nbsp; Just opposite me, smoking their pipes, were a couple
of men, something like engineers, and they were talking of a wonderful
invention which was to make a wonderful alteration in England; inasmuch
as it would set aside all the old roads, which in a little time would
be ploughed up, and sowed with corn, and cause all England to be laid
down with iron roads, on which people would go thundering along in vehicles,
pushed forward by fire and smoke.&nbsp; Now, brother, when I heard this,
I did not feel very comfortable; for I thought to myself, what a queer
place such a road would be to pitch one&rsquo;s tent upon, and how impossible
it would be for one&rsquo;s cattle to find a bite of grass upon it;
and I thought likewise of the danger to which one&rsquo;s family would
be exposed of being run over and severely scorched by these same flying,
fiery vehicles; so I made bold to say that I hoped such an invention
would never be countenanced, because it was likely to do a great deal
of harm.&nbsp; Whereupon, one of the men, giving me a glance, said,
without taking <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>the
pipe out of his mouth, that for his part he sincerely hoped that it
would take effect; and if it did no other good than stopping the rambles
of gypsies, and other like scamps, it ought to be encouraged.&nbsp;
Well, brother, feeling myself insulted, I put my hand into my pocket,
in order to pull out money, intending to challenge him to fight for
a five-shilling stake, but merely found sixpence, having left all my
other money at the tent; which sixpence was just sufficient to pay for
the beer which Sylvester and myself were drinking, of whom I couldn&rsquo;t
hope to borrow anything&mdash;&lsquo;poor as Sylvester&rsquo; being
a by-word amongst us.&nbsp; So, not being able to back myself, I held
my peace, and let the Gorgio have it all his own way, who, after turning
up his nose at me, went on discoursing about the said invention, saying
what a fund of profit it would be to those who knew how to make use
of it, and should have the laying down of the new roads, and the shoeing
of England with iron.&nbsp; And after he had said this, and much more
of the same kind, which I cannot remember, he and his companion got
up and walked away; and presently I and Sylvester got up and walked
to our camp; and there I lay down in my tent by the side of my wife,
where I had an ugly dream of having camped upon an iron road; my tent
being overturned by a flying vehicle; my wife&rsquo;s leg injured; and
all my affairs put into great confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;I have braided
your hair in our fashion: you look very beautiful, madam; more beautiful,
if possible, than before.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle now rose, and came forward
with her <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>tire-woman.&nbsp;
Mr. Petulengro was loud in his applause, but I said nothing, for I did
not think Belle was improved in appearance by having submitted to the
ministry of Mrs. Petulengro&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Nature never intended
Belle to appear as a gypsy; she had made her too proud and serious.&nbsp;
A more proper part for her was that of a heroine, a queenly heroine,&mdash;that
of Theresa of Hungary, for example; or, better still, that of Brynhilda
the Valkyrie, the beloved of Sigurd, the serpent-killer, who incurred
the curse of Odin, because, in the tumult of spears, she sided with
the young king, and doomed the old warrior to die, to whom Odin had
promised victory.</p>
<p>Belle looked at me for a moment in silence; then turning to Mrs.
Petulengro, she said, &ldquo;You have had your will with me; are you
satisfied?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite so, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro,
&ldquo;and I hope you will be so too, as soon as you have looked in
the glass.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have looked in one already,&rdquo;
said Belle, &ldquo;and the glass does not flatter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mean the face of the young rye,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;never
mind him, madam; the young rye, though he knows a thing or two, is not
a university, nor a person of universal wisdom.&nbsp; I assure you that
you never looked so well before; and I hope that, from this moment,
you will wear your hair in this way.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And who is
to braid it in this way?&rdquo; said Belle, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I,
madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;I will braid it for you every
morning, if you will but be persuaded to join us.&nbsp; Do so, madam,
and I think, if you did, the young rye would do so <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>too.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The young rye is nothing to me, nor I to him,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;we have stayed some time together; but our paths will soon be
apart.&nbsp; Now, farewell, for I am about to take a journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you will go out with your hair as I have braided it,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;if you do, everybody will be in love with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;hitherto I have
allowed you to do what you please, but henceforth I shall have my own
way.&nbsp; Come, come,&rdquo; said she, observing that the gypsy was
about to speak, &ldquo;we have had enough of nonsense; whenever I leave
this hollow, it will be wearing my hair in my own fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;we will no longer
intrude upon the rye and rawnie, there is such a thing as being troublesome.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon Mr. Petulengro and his wife took their leave, with many salutations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then you are going?&rdquo; said I, when Belle and I were left
alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I am going on a journey;
my affairs compel me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But you will return again?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I shall return once
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what do you
mean by once more?&nbsp; The Petulengros will soon be gone, and will
you abandon me in this place?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You were alone here,&rdquo;
said Belle, &ldquo;before I came, and, I suppose, found it agreeable,
or you would not have stayed in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;that was before I knew you; but having lived with you
here, I should be very loth to live here without you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;
said Belle, &ldquo;I did not know that I was of so much consequence
to you.&nbsp; Well, the day is wearing away&mdash;I must go and harness
Traveller <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>to
the cart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or
anything else you may wish me.&nbsp; Go and prepare yourself; I will
see after Traveller and the cart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle departed to her
tent, and I set about performing the task I had undertaken.&nbsp; In
about half-an-hour Belle again made her appearance&mdash;she was dressed
neatly and plainly.&nbsp; Her hair was no longer in the Roman fashion,
in which Pakomovna had plaited it, but was secured by a comb; she held
a bonnet in her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there anything else I can do for
you?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are two or three bundles
by my tent, which you can put into the cart,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
I put the bundles into the cart, and then led Traveller and the cart
up the winding path, to the mouth of the dingle, near which was Mr.
Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; Belle followed.&nbsp; At the top,
I delivered the reins into her hands; we looked at each other steadfastly
for some time.&nbsp; Belle then departed and I returned to the dingle,
where, seating myself on my stone, I remained for upwards of an hour
in thought.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;THE FESTIVAL&mdash;THE GYPSY SONG&mdash;PIRAMUS
OF ROME&mdash;THE SCOTCHMAN&mdash;GYPSY NAMES.</h2>
<p>On the following day there was much feasting amongst the Romany chals
of Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s party.&nbsp; Throughout the forenoon the Romany
chies did scarcely anything but cook flesh, and the flesh which they
cooked was swine&rsquo;s flesh.&nbsp; About two o&rsquo;clock, the chals
and <!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>chies
dividing themselves into various parties, sat down and partook of the
fare, which was partly roasted, partly sodden.&nbsp; I dined that day
with Mr. Petulengro and his wife and family, Ursula, Mr. and Mrs. Chikno,
and Sylvester and his two children.&nbsp; Sylvester, it will be as well
to say, was a widower, and had consequently no one to cook his victuals
for him, supposing he had any, which was not always the case, Sylvester&rsquo;s
affairs being seldom in a prosperous state.&nbsp; He was noted for his
bad success in trafficking, notwithstanding the many hints which he
received from Jasper, under whose protection he had placed himself,
even as Tawno Chikno had done, who himself, as the reader has heard
on a former occasion, was anything but a wealthy subject, though he
was at all times better off than Sylvester, the Lazarus of the Romany
tribe.</p>
<p>All our party ate with a good appetite, except myself, who, feeling
rather melancholy that day, had little desire to eat.&nbsp; I did not,
like the others, partake of the pork, but got my dinner entirely off
the body of a squirrel which had been shot the day before by a chal
of the name of Piramus, who, besides being a good shot, was celebrated
for his skill in playing on the fiddle.&nbsp; During the dinner a horn
filled with ale passed frequently around, I drank of it more than once,
and felt inspirited by the draughts.&nbsp; The repast concluded, Sylvester
and his children departed to their tent, and Mr. Petulengro, Tawno,
and myself getting up, went and lay down under a shady hedge, where
Mr. Petulengro, lighting his pipe, began to smoke, and <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>where
Tawno presently fell asleep.&nbsp; I was about to fall asleep also,
when I heard the sound of music and song.&nbsp; Piramus was playing
on the fiddle, whilst Mrs. Chikno, who had a voice of her own, was singing
in tones sharp enough, but of great power, a gypsy song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>POISONING THE PORKER.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Which song I had translated in the following manner, in my younger
days, for a lady&rsquo;s album.</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen to me ye Roman lads, who are seated in the straw
about the fire, and I will tell how we poison the porker, I will tell
how we poison the porker.</p>
<p>We go to the house of the poison monger (<i>i.e.</i> the apothecary),
where we buy three pennies&rsquo; worth of bane, and when we return
to our people we say, we will poison the porker; we will try and poison
the porker.</p>
<p>We then make up the poison, and then we take our way to the house
of the farmer, as if to beg a bit of victuals, a little broken victuals.</p>
<p>We see a jolly porker, and then we say in Roman language, &ldquo;Fling
the bane yonder amongst the dirt, and the porker soon will find it,
the porker soon will find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early on the morrow, we will return to the farmhouse, and beg the
dead porker, the body of the dead porker.</p>
<p><!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>And
so we do, even so we do; the porker dieth during the night; on the morrow
we beg the porker, and carry to the tent the porker.</p>
<p>And then we wash the inside well, till all the inside is perfectly
clean, till there&rsquo;s no bane within it, not a poison grain within
it.</p>
<p>And then we roast the body well, send for ale to the ale-house, and
have a merry banquet, a merry Roman banquet.</p>
<p>The fellow with the fiddle plays, he plays; the little lassie sings,
she sings an ancient Roman ditty; now hear the Roman ditty.</p>

<p><!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
some kernel in those songs, brother,&rdquo; said Mr Petulengro, when
the songs and music were over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are certainly very remarkable
songs.&nbsp; I say, Jasper, I hope you have not been drabbing baulor
<a name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266">{266}</a> lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose we have, brother, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is a very dangerous practice, to say nothing of the
wickedness of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessity has no law, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have always said so,
but you are not necessitous, and should not drab baulor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who told you we had been drabbing baulor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you have had a banquet of pork, and after the banquet
Mrs. Chikno sang a song about drabbing baulor, so I naturally thought
you might have lately been engaged in such a thing&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, you occasionally utter a word or two of common sense.&nbsp;
It was natural for you to suppose, after seeing that dinner of pork,
and hearing that song, that we had been drabbing baulor; I will now
tell you <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>that
we have not been doing so.&nbsp; What have you to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am very glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you tasted that pork, brother, you would have found that
it was sweet and tasty, which balluva that is drabbed can hardly be
expected to be.&nbsp; We have no reason to drab baulor at present, we
have money and credit; but necessity has no law.&nbsp; Our forefathers
occasionally drabbed baulor, some of our people may still do such a
thing, but only from compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and at your merry meetings you
sing songs upon the compulsatory deeds of your people, alias their villainous
actions; and, after all, what would the stirring poetry of any nation
be, but for its compulsatory deeds?&nbsp; Look at the poetry of Scotland,
the heroic part, founded almost entirely on the villainous deeds of
the Scotch nation; cow-stealing, for example, which is very little better
than drabbing baulor; whilst the softer part is mostly about the slips
of its females among the broom, so that no upholder of Scotch poetry
could censure Ursula&rsquo;s song as indelicate, even if he understood
it.&nbsp; What do you think, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, brother, as I before said, that occasionally you
utter a word of common sense.&nbsp; You were talking of the Scotch,
brother; what do you think of a Scotchman finding fault with Romany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Scotchman finding fault with Romany, Jasper!&nbsp; Oh dear,
but you joke, the thing could never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and at Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle; what do you think of a
Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>&ldquo;A
Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle! nonsense, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I most dislike, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, unless it be the constable, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the constable, it&rsquo;s a beggar on horseback,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a beggar on horseback?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a scamp, brother, raised above his proper place, who
takes every opportunity of giving himself fine airs.&nbsp; About a week
ago, my people and myself camped on a green by a plantation in the neighbourhood
of a great house.&nbsp; In the evening we were making merry, the girls
were dancing, while Piramus was playing on the fiddle a tune of his
own composing, to which he has given his own name, Piramus of Rome,
and which is much celebrated amongst our people, and from which I have
been told that one of the grand gorgio composers, who once heard it,
has taken several hints.&nbsp; So, as we were making merry, a great
many grand people, lords and ladies, I believe, came from the great
house and looked on, as the girls danced to the tune of Piramus of Rome,
and seemed much pleased; and when the girls had left off dancing, and
Piramus playing, the ladies wanted to have their fortunes told; so I
bade Mikailia Chikno, who can tell a fortune when she pleases better
than any one else, tell them a fortune, and she, being in a good mind,
told them a fortune which pleased them very much.&nbsp; So, after they
had heard their fortunes, one of them asked if any of our women could
sing; and I told them several could, <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>more
particularly Leviathan&mdash;you know Leviathan, she is not here now,
but some miles distant, she is our best singer, Ursula coming next.&nbsp;
So the lady said she should like to hear Leviathan sing, whereupon Leviathan
sang the Gudlo pesham, <a name="citation269a"></a><a href="#footnote269a">{269a}</a>
and Piramus played the tune of the same name, which, as you know, means
the honeycomb, the song and the tune being well entitled to the name,
being wonderfully sweet.&nbsp; Well, everybody present seemed mighty
well pleased with the song and music, with the exception of one person,
a carroty-haired Scotch body; how he came there I don&rsquo;t know,
but there he was; and, coming forward, he began in Scotch as broad as
a barn-door to find fault with the music and the song, saying that he
had never heard viler stuff than either.&nbsp; Well, brother, out of
consideration for the civil gentry with whom the fellow had come, I
held my peace for a long time, and in order to get the subject changed,
I said to Mikailia in Romany, you have told the ladies their fortunes,
now tell the gentlemen theirs, quick quick,&mdash;pen lende dukkerin.
<a name="citation269b"></a><a href="#footnote269b">{269b}</a>&nbsp;
Well, brother, the Scotchman, I suppose, thinking I was speaking ill
of him, fell into a greater passion than before, and catching hold of
the word dukkerin&mdash;&lsquo;Dukkerin,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s
dukkerin?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Dukkerin,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is fortune,
a man or woman&rsquo;s destiny; don&rsquo;t you like the word?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Word! d&rsquo;ye ca&rsquo; that a word? a bonnie word,&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell us what it is in Scotch,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;in order that we may improve our language by a Scotch
word; <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>a
pal of mine has told me that we have taken a great many words from foreign
lingos.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, then, if that be the case, fellow,
I will tell you; it is e&rsquo;en &ldquo;spaeing,&rdquo;&rsquo; said
he, very seriously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
keep my own word, which is much the prettiest&mdash;spaeing! spaeing!
why, I should be ashamed to make use of the word, it sounds so much
like a certain other word;&rsquo; and then I made a face as if I were
unwell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Scotch also for that?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you mean by speaking in that guise to a gentleman?&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;you insolent vagabond, without a name or a country.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;There you are mistaken,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;my country is Egypt,
but we &rsquo;Gyptians, like you Scotch, are rather fond of travelling;
and as for name&mdash;my name is Jasper Petulengro, perhaps you have
a better; what is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sandy Macraw.&rsquo;&nbsp;
At that, brother, the gentlemen burst into a roar of laughter, and all
the ladies tittered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were rather severe on the Scotchman, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, brother, and suppose I were, he began first; I
am the civilest man in the world, and never interfere with anybody who
lets me and mine alone.&nbsp; He finds fault with Romany, forsooth!
why, L---d A&rsquo;mighty, what&rsquo;s Scotch?&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t
like our songs; what are his own?&nbsp; I understand them as little
as he mine; I have heard one or two of them, and pretty rubbish they
seemed.&nbsp; But the best of the joke is the fellow&rsquo;s finding
fault with Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle&mdash;a chap from the land of bagpipes
finding fault with Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll back
that fiddle against all the <!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>bagpipes
in Scotland, and Piramus against all the bagpipers; for though Piramus
weighs but ten stone, he shall flog a Scotchman of twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scotchmen are never so fat as that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;unless,
indeed, they have been a long time pensioners of England.&nbsp; I say,
Jasper, what remarkable names your people have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what pretty names, brother; there&rsquo;s my own, for
example, Jasper; then there&rsquo;s Ambrose and Sylvester; then there&rsquo;s
Culvato, which signifies Claude; then there&rsquo;s Piramus, that&rsquo;s
a nice name, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s your wife&rsquo;s name, Pakomovna; then
there&rsquo;s Ursula and Morella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, brother, there&rsquo;s Ercilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ercilla! the name of the great poet of Spain, how wonderful;
then Leviathan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of a ship, brother; Leviathan was named after a ship,
so don&rsquo;t make a wonder out of her.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s Sanpriel
and Synfye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and Clementina and Lavinia, Camillia and Lydia, Curlanda
and Orlanda; wherever did they get those names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did my wife get her necklace, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows best, Jasper.&nbsp; I hope . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, no hoping!&nbsp; She got it from her grandmother, who
died at the age of a hundred and three, and sleeps in Coggeshall churchyard.&nbsp;
She got it from her mother, who also died very old, and could give no
other account of it than that it had been in the family time out of
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>&ldquo;Whence
could they have got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, perhaps where they got their names, brother.&nbsp; A
gentleman, who had travelled much, once told me that he had seen the
sister of it about the neck of an Indian queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of your names, Jasper, appear to be church names; your
own, for example, and Ambrose, and Sylvester; perhaps you got them from
the Papists, in the times of Popery; but where did you get such a name
as Piramus, a name of Grecian romance?&nbsp; Then some of them appear
to be Slavonian; for example, Mikailia and Pakomovna.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know much of Slavonian; but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Slavonian, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family name of certain nations, the principal of which
is the Russian, and from which the word slave is originally derived.&nbsp;
You have heard of the Russians, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother; and seen some.&nbsp; I saw their crallis at
the time of the peace; he was not a bad-looking man for a Russian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye, Jasper, I&rsquo;m half inclined to think that
crallis <a name="citation272"></a><a href="#footnote272">{272}</a> is
a Slavish word.&nbsp; I saw something like it in a lil called &lsquo;Voltaire&rsquo;s
Life of Charles XII.&rsquo;&nbsp; How you should have come by such names
and words is to me incomprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem posed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really know very little about you, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little indeed, brother.&nbsp; We know very little about
ourselves; and you know nothing, save what we <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>have
told you; and we have now and then told you things about us which are
not exactly true, simply to make a fool of you, brother.&nbsp; You will
say that was wrong; perhaps it was.&nbsp; Well, Sunday will be here
in a day or two, when we will go to church, where possibly we shall
hear a sermon on the disastrous consequences of lying.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;THE CHURCH&mdash;THE ARISTOCRATICAL PEW&mdash;DAYS
OF YORE&mdash;THE CLERGYMAN&mdash;&ldquo;IN WHAT WOULD A MAN BE PROFITED?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When two days had passed, Sunday came; I breakfasted by myself in
the solitary dingle; and then, having set things a little to rights,
I ascended to Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; I could hear
church-bells ringing around in the distance, appearing to say, &ldquo;Come
to church, come to church,&rdquo; as clearly as it was possible for
church-bells to say.&nbsp; I found Mr. Petulengro seated by the door
of his tent, smoking his pipe, in rather an ungenteel undress.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, Jasper,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are you ready to go to church?
for if you are, I am ready to accompany you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not ready, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;nor is my wife;
the church, too, to which we shall go is three miles off; so it is of
no use to think of going there this morning, as the service would be
three-quarters over before we got there; if, however, you are disposed
to go in the afternoon, we are your people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I
returned to my dingle, <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>where
I passed several hours in conning the Welsh Bible, which the preacher,
Peter Williams, <a name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274">{274}</a>
had given me.</p>
<p>At last I gave over reading, took a slight refreshment, and was about
to emerge from the dingle, when I heard the voice of Mr. Petulengro
calling me.&nbsp; I went up again to the encampment, where I found Mr.
Petulengro, his wife, and Tawno Chikno, ready to proceed to church.&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro were dressed in Roman fashion, though not in
the full-blown manner in which they had paid their visit to Isopel and
myself.&nbsp; Tawno had on a clean white slop, with a nearly new black
beaver, with very broad rims, and the nap exceedingly long.&nbsp; As
for myself, I was dressed in much the same manner as that in which I
departed from London, having on, in honour of the day, a shirt perfectly
clean, having washed one on purpose for the occasion, with my own hands,
the day before, in the pond of tepid water in which the newts and efts
were in the habit of taking their pleasure.&nbsp; We proceeded for upwards
of a mile, by footpaths through meadows and corn-fields; we crossed
various stiles; at last, passing over one, we found ourselves in a road,
wending along which for a considerable distance, we at last came in
sight of a church, the bells of which had been tolling distinctly in
our ears for some time; before, however, we reached the churchyard the
bells had ceased their melody.&nbsp; It was surrounded by lofty beech-trees
of brilliant green foliage.&nbsp; We entered the gate, Mrs. Petulengro
leading the way, and proceeded to a small door near the east end of
the <!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>church.&nbsp;
As we advanced, the sound of singing within the church rose upon our
ears.&nbsp; Arrived at the small door, Mrs. Petulengro opened it and
entered, followed by Tawno Chikno.&nbsp; I myself went last of all,
following Mr. Petulengro, who, before I entered, turned round and, with
a significant nod, advised me to take care how I behaved.&nbsp; The
part of the church <a name="citation275"></a><a href="#footnote275">{275}</a>
which we had entered was the chancel; on one side stood a number of
venerable old men&mdash;probably the neighbouring poor&mdash;and on
the other a number of poor girls belonging to the village school, dressed
in white gowns and straw bonnets, whom two elegant but simply dressed
young women were superintending.&nbsp; Every voice seemed to be united
in singing a certain anthem, which, notwithstanding it was written neither
by Tate nor Brady, contains some of the sublimest words which were ever
put together, not the worst of which are those which burst on our ears
as we entered.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every eye shall now behold Him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Robed in dreadful majesty;<br />
Those who set at nought and sold Him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeply wailing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the true Messiah see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still following Mrs. Petulengro, we proceeded down the chancel and
along the aisle; notwithstanding the singing, I could distinctly hear
as we passed many a <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>voice
whispering, &ldquo;Here come the gypsies! here come the gypsies!&rdquo;&nbsp;
I felt rather embarrassed, with a somewhat awkward doubt as to where
we were to sit; none of the occupiers of the pews, who appeared to consist
almost entirely of farmers, with their wives, sons, and daughters, opened
a door to admit us.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro, however, appeared to feel
not the least embarrassment, but tripped along the aisle with the greatest
nonchalance.&nbsp; We passed under the pulpit, in which stood the clergyman
in his white surplice, and reached the middle of the church, where we
were confronted by the sexton, dressed in a long blue coat, and holding
in his hand a wand.&nbsp; This functionary motioned towards the lower
end of the church, where were certain benches, partly occupied by poor
people and boys.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro, however, with a toss of her
head, directed her course to a magnificent pew, which was unoccupied,
which she opened and entered, followed closely by Tawno Chikno, Mr.
Petulengro, and myself.&nbsp; The sexton did not appear by any means
to approve of the arrangement, and as I stood next the door laid his
finger on my arm, as if to intimate that myself and companions must
quit our aristocratical location.&nbsp; I said nothing, but directed
my eyes to the clergyman, who uttered a short and expressive cough;
the sexton looked at him for a moment, and then, bowing his head, closed
the door&mdash;in a moment more the music ceased.&nbsp; I took up a
prayer-book, on which was engraved an earl&rsquo;s coronet.&nbsp; The
clergyman uttered, &ldquo;I will arise, and go to my father.&rdquo;&nbsp;
England&rsquo;s sublime liturgy had commenced.</p>
<p><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>Oh,
what feelings came over me on finding myself again in an edifice devoted
to the religion of my country!&nbsp; I had not been in such a place
I cannot tell how long&mdash;certainly not for years; and now I had
found my way there again, it appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the
pew of the old church of pretty D[ereham].&nbsp; I had occasionally
done so when a child, and had suddenly woke up.&nbsp; Yes, surely I
had been asleep and had woken up; but, no! alas, no!&nbsp; I had not
been asleep&mdash;at least not in the old church&mdash;if I had been
asleep I had been walking in my sleep, struggling, striving, learning,
and unlearning in my sleep.&nbsp; Years had rolled away whilst I had
been asleep&mdash;ripe fruit had fallen, green fruit had come on whilst
I had been asleep&mdash;how circumstances had altered, and above all
myself, whilst I had been asleep.&nbsp; No, I had not been asleep in
the old church!&nbsp; I was in a pew it is true, but not the pew of
black leather, in which I sometimes fell asleep in days of yore, but
in a strange pew; and then my companions, they were no longer those
of days of yore.&nbsp; I was no longer with my respectable father and
mother, and my dear brother, but with the gypsy cral <a name="citation277"></a><a href="#footnote277">{277}</a>
and his wife, and the gigantic Tawno, the Antinous of the dusky people.&nbsp;
And what was I myself?&nbsp; No longer an innocent child, but a moody
man, bearing in my face, as I knew well, the marks of my strivings and
strugglings, of what I had learned and unlearned; nevertheless, the
general aspect of things brought to my mind what I had felt and seen
of yore.&nbsp; <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>There
was difference enough it is true, but still there was a similarity&mdash;at
least I thought so,&mdash;the church, the clergyman, and the clerk differing
in many respects from those of pretty D . . ., put me strangely in mind
of them; and then the words!&mdash;by-the-bye, was it not the magic
of the words which brought the dear enchanting past so powerfully before
the mind of Lavengro? for the words were the same sonorous words of
high import which had first made an impression on his childish ear in
the old church of pretty Dereham.</p>
<p>The liturgy was now over, during the reading of which my companions
behaved in a most unexceptional manner, sitting down and rising up when
other people sat down and rose, and holding in their hands prayer-books
which they found in the pew, into which they stared intently, though
I observed that, with the exception of Mrs. Petulengro, who knew how
to read a little, they held the books by the top, and not the bottom,
as is the usual way.&nbsp; The clergyman now ascended the pulpit, arrayed
in his black gown.&nbsp; The congregation composed themselves to attention,
as did also my companions, who fixed their eyes upon the clergyman with
a certain strange immovable stare, which I believe to be peculiar to
their race.&nbsp; The clergyman gave out his text, and began to preach.&nbsp;
He was a tall, gentlemanly man, seemingly between fifty and sixty, with
greyish hair; his features were very handsome, but with a somewhat melancholy
cast: the tones of his voice were rich and noble, but also with somewhat
of melancholy in them.&nbsp; The text which he gave out was the following
<!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>one:
&ldquo;In what would a man be profited, provided he gained the whole
world, and lost his own soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on this text the clergyman preached long and well: he did not
read his sermon, but spoke it extempore; his doing so rather surprised
and offended me at first; I was not used to such a style of preaching
in a church devoted to the religion of my country.&nbsp; I compared
it within my mind with the style of preaching used by the high-church
rector in the old church of pretty D . . ., and I thought to myself
it was very different, and being very different I did not like it, and
I thought to myself how scandalised the people of D . . . would have
been had they heard it, and I figured to myself how indignant the high-church
clerk would have been had any clergyman got up in the church of D .
. . and preached in such a manner.&nbsp; Did it not savour strongly
of dissent, methodism, and similar low stuff?&nbsp; Surely it did; why,
the Methodist I had heard preach on the heath above the old city, preached
in the same manner&mdash;at least he preached extempore; ay, and something
like the present clergyman, for the Methodist spoke very zealously and
with great feeling, and so did the present clergyman; so I, of course,
felt rather offended with the clergyman for speaking with zeal and feeling.&nbsp;
However, long before the sermon was over I forgot the offence which
I had taken, and listened to the sermon with much admiration, for the
eloquence and powerful reasoning with which it abounded.</p>
<p>Oh, how eloquent he was, when he talked on the <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>inestimable
value of a man&rsquo;s soul, which he said endured for ever, whilst
his body, as every one knew, lasted at most for a very contemptible
period of time; and how forcibly he reasoned on the folly of a man,
who, for the sake of gaining the whole world&mdash;a thing, he said,
which provided he gained he could only possess for a part of the time,
during which his perishable body existed&mdash;should lose his soul,
that is, cause that precious deathless portion of him to suffer indescribable
misery time without end.</p>
<p>There was one part of his sermon which struck me in a very particular
manner: he said, &ldquo;That there were some people who gained something
in return for their souls; if they did not get the whole world, they
got a part of it&mdash;lands, wealth, honour, or renown; mere trifles,
he allowed, in comparison with the value of a man&rsquo;s soul, which
is destined either to enjoy delight, or suffer tribulation time without
end; but which, in the eyes of the worldly, had a certain value, and
which afforded a certain pleasure and satisfaction.&nbsp; But there
were also others who lost their souls, and got nothing for them&mdash;neither
lands, wealth, renown, nor consideration, who were poor outcasts, and
despised by everybody.&nbsp; My friends,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if
the man is a fool who barters his soul for the whole world, what a fool
he must be who barters his soul for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the clergyman, as he uttered these words, wandered around
the whole congregation; and when he had concluded them, the eyes of
the whole congregation were turned upon my companions and myself.</p>
<h2><!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>CHAPTER
XXV.&mdash;RETURN FROM CHURCH&mdash;THE CUCKOO AND GYPSY&mdash;SPIRITUAL
DISCOURSE.</h2>
<p>The service over, my companions and myself returned towards the encampment
by the way we came.&nbsp; Some of the humble part of the congregation
laughed and joked at us as we passed.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro and his wife,
however, returned their laughs and jokes with interest.&nbsp; As for
Tawno and myself, we said nothing: Tawno, like most handsome fellows,
having very little to say for himself at any time; and myself, though
not handsome, not being particularly skilful at repartee.&nbsp; Some
boys followed us for a considerable time, making all kinds of observations
about gypsies; but as we walked at a great pace, we gradually left them
behind, and at last lost sight of them.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro and Tawno
Chikno walked together, even as they had come; whilst Mr. Petulengro
and myself followed at a little distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very fine preacher we heard,&rdquo; said I to Mr.
Petulengro, after we had crossed the stile into the fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine, indeed, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;he
is talked of, far and wide, for his sermons; folks say that there is
scarcely another like him in the whole of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks rather melancholy, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lost his wife several years ago, who, they say, <!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>was
one of the most beautiful women ever seen.&nbsp; They say that it was
grief for her loss that made him come out mighty strong as a preacher;
for, though he was a clergyman, he was never heard of in the pulpit
before he lost his wife; since then the whole country has rung with
the preaching of the clergyman of M . . ., as they call him.&nbsp; Those
two nice young gentlewomen, whom you saw with the female childer, are
his daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know all about him, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you ever
hear him preach before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother; but he has frequently been to our tent, and
his daughters too, and given us tracts; for he is one of the people
they call Evangelicals, who give folks tracts which they cannot read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should learn to read, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no time, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not frequently idle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother; when we are not engaged in our traffic, we
are engaged in taking our relaxation: so we have no time to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really should make an effort.&nbsp; If you were disposed
to learn to read, I would endeavour to assist you.&nbsp; You would be
all the better for knowing how to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you could read the Scriptures, and, by so doing, learn
your duty towards your fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that already, brother; the constables and justices
have contrived to knock that tolerably into our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>&ldquo;Yet
you frequently break the laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I believe, do now and then those who know how to read,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, Jasper; but you really ought to learn to read,
as, by so doing, you might learn your duty towards yourselves: and your
chief duty is to take care of your own souls; did not the preacher say,
&lsquo;In what is a man profited, provided he gain the whole world&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not much of the world, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little indeed, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you not observe how
the eyes of the whole congregation were turned towards our pew when
the preacher said, &lsquo;There are some people who lose their souls,
and get nothing in exchange; who are outcast, despised, and miserable?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now, was not what he said quite applicable to the gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not miserable, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you ought to be, Jasper.&nbsp; Have you an inch
of ground of your own?&nbsp; Are you of the least use?&nbsp; Are you
not spoken ill of by everybody?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a gypsy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bird noising yonder, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird!&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s the cuckoo tolling; but what
has the cuckoo to do with the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, brother; what&rsquo;s the cuckoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? you know as much about it as myself, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a kind of roguish, chaffing bird, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>&ldquo;Nobody
knows whence it comes, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe not, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very poor, brother, not a nest of its own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they say, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With every person&rsquo;s bad word, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper, every person is mocking it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolerably merry, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tolerably merry, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be glad to get rid of the cuckoos, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not exactly, Jasper; the cuckoo is a pleasant, funny
bird, and its presence and voice give a great charm to the green trees
and fields; no, I can&rsquo;t say I wish exactly to get rid of the cuckoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, what&rsquo;s a Romany chal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must answer that question yourself, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A roguish, chaffing fellow, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t he, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, Jasper; I see . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something very much like a cuckoo, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are after, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like to get rid of us, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are no ornament to the green lanes in spring and summer
time, are we, brother? and the voices of our chies, with their cukkerin
and dukkerin, don&rsquo;t help to make them pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>&ldquo;I
see what you are at, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would wish to turn the cuckoos into barn-door fowls, wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I should, Jasper, whatever some people might
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the chals and chies into radical weavers and factory wenches,
hey, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that I should, Jasper.&nbsp; You are certainly
a picturesque people, and in many respects an ornament both to town
and country; painting and lil writing too are under great obligations
to you.&nbsp; What pretty pictures are made out of your campings and
groupings, and what pretty books have been written in which gypsies,
or at least creatures intended to represent gypsies, have been the principal
figures!&nbsp; I think if we were without you, we should begin to miss
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you would the cuckoos, if they were all converted
into barn-door fowls.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, frequently as
I have sat under a hedge in spring or summer time, and heard the cuckoo,
I have thought that we chals and cuckoos are alike in many respects,
but especially in character.&nbsp; Everybody speaks ill of us both,
and everybody is glad to see both of us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper, but there is some difference between men and
cuckoos; men have souls, Jasper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not cuckoos, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not talk so, Jasper; what you say is little short
of blasphemy.&nbsp; How should a bird have a soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>&ldquo;And
how should a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know very well that a man has a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you take your oath of it, brother&mdash;your bodily
oath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I think I might, Jasper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the soul, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how could you swear to it?&nbsp; A pretty figure you
would make in a court of justice, to swear to a thing which you never
saw.&nbsp; Hold up your head, fellow.&nbsp; When and where did you see
it?&nbsp; Now upon your oath, fellow, do you mean to say that this Roman
stole the donkey&rsquo;s foal?&nbsp; Oh, there&rsquo;s no one for cross-questioning
like Counsellor P . . .&nbsp; Our people when they are in a hobble always
like to employ him, though he is somewhat dear.&nbsp; Now, brother,
how can you get over the &lsquo;upon your oath, fellow, will you say
that you have a soul?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will take no oath on the subject; but you yourself
believe in the soul.&nbsp; I have heard you say that you believe in
dukkerin; now what is dukkerin <a name="citation286"></a><a href="#footnote286">{286}</a>
but the soul science?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did I say that I believed in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, after that fight, when you pointed to the bloody mark
in the cloud, whilst he you wot of was galloping in the barouche to
the old town, amidst the rain-cataracts, the thunder, and flame of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>&ldquo;I
have some kind of remembrance of it, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, again, I heard you say that the dook of Abershaw rode
every night on horseback down the wooded hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother, what a wonderful memory you have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had not, Jasper, but I can&rsquo;t help it; it is
my misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misfortune! well, perhaps it is; at any rate it is very ungenteel
to have such a memory.&nbsp; I have heard my wife say that to show you
have a long memory looks very vulgar; and that you can&rsquo;t give
a greater proof of gentility than by forgetting a thing as soon as possible&mdash;more
especially a promise, or an acquaintance when he happens to be shabby.&nbsp;
Well, brother, I don&rsquo;t deny that I may have said that I believe
in dukkerin, and in Abershaw&rsquo;s dook, which you say is his soul;
but what I believe one moment, or say I believe, don&rsquo;t be certain
that I shall believe the next, or say I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Jasper, I heard you say on a previous occasion, on
quoting a piece of song, that when a man dies he is cast into the earth,
and there&rsquo;s an end of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, did I?&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, what a memory you have, brother!&nbsp;
But you are not sure that I hold that opinion now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Jasper.&nbsp; Indeed, after such a sermon as
we have been hearing, I should be very shocked if you held such an opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>&ldquo;However,
brother, don&rsquo;t be sure I do not, however shocking such an opinion
may be to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an incomprehensible people you are, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are rather so, brother; indeed, we have posed wiser heads
than yours before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to care for so little, and yet you rove about a distinct
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of our women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have certainly very singular names, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names!&nbsp; Lavengro!&nbsp; But, brother, if you had been
as fond of things as of names, you would never have been a pal of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they rum animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have tongues of their own, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever feel their teeth and nails, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Jasper, save Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s. <a name="citation288"></a><a href="#footnote288">{288}</a>&nbsp;
I have always been very civil to them, so . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They let you alone.&nbsp; I say, brother, some part of the
secret is in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem rather flighty, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather fond of loose discourse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather so, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you always trust them, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never watch them, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they always trust you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>&ldquo;Not
quite so well as we can them.&nbsp; However, we get on very well together,
except Mikailia and her husband; but Mikailia is a cripple, and is married
to the beauty of the world, so she may be expected to be jealous&mdash;though
he would not part with her for a duchess, no more than I would part
with my rawnie, nor any other chal with his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but would not the chi part with the chal for a duke, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Pakomovna gave up the duke for me, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she occasionally talks of him, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, but Pakomovna was born on a common not far from
the sign of the gammon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gammon of bacon, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother; but gammon likewise means . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it does, Jasper; it means fun, ridicule, jest; it is
an ancient Norse word, and is found in the Edda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, brother! how learned in lils you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many words of Norse are to be found in our vulgar sayings,
Jasper; for example&mdash;in that particularly vulgar saying of ours,
&lsquo;Your mother is up,&rsquo; <a name="citation289"></a><a href="#footnote289">{289}</a>
there&rsquo;s a noble Norse word; mother, there, meaning not the female
who bore us, but rage and choler, as I discovered by reading the Sagas,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,
brother! how book-learned you be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indifferently so, Jasper.&nbsp; Then you think you might trust
your wife with the duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could, brother, or even with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself, Jasper!&nbsp; Oh, I never troubled my head about your
wife; but I suppose there have been love affairs between gorgios <a name="citation290"></a><a href="#footnote290">{290}</a>
and Romany chies.&nbsp; Why, novels are stuffed with such matters; and
then even one of your own songs says so&mdash;the song which Ursula
was singing the other afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is somewhat of an old song, brother, and is sung by the
chies as a warning at our solemn festivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! but there&rsquo;s your sister-in-law, Ursula, herself,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ursula, herself, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking of my having her, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, why didn&rsquo;t you have her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she have had me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, brother.&nbsp; You are so much of a Roman, and
speak Romany so remarkably well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing! she looks very innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkably so, brother!&nbsp; However, though not born on
the same common with my wife, she knows a thing or two of Roman matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to ask her a question or two, Jasper, in connection
with that song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do no better, brother.&nbsp; Here we are at the camp.&nbsp;
After tea, take Ursula under a hedge, and ask her a question or two
in connection with that song.&rdquo;</p>

XXVI.&mdash;SUNDAY EVENING&mdash;URSULA&mdash;ACTION AT LAW&mdash;MERIDIANA
MARRIED ALREADY.</h2>
<p>I took tea that evening with Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro and Ursula,
<a name="citation291"></a><a href="#footnote291">{291}</a> outside of
their tent.&nbsp; Tawno was not present, being engaged with his wife
in his own tabernacle; Sylvester was there, however, lolling listlessly
upon the ground.&nbsp; As I looked upon this man, I thought him one
of the most disagreeable fellows I had ever seen.&nbsp; His features
were ugly, and, moreover, as dark as pepper; and, besides being dark,
his skin was dirty.&nbsp; As for his dress, it was torn and sordid.&nbsp;
His chest was broad, and his arms seemed powerful; but, upon the whole,
he looked a very caitiff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry that man has lost
his wife,&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;for I am sure he <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>will
never get another.&rdquo;&nbsp; What surprises me is, that he ever found
a woman disposed to unite her lot with his!</p>
<p>After tea I got up and strolled about the field.&nbsp; My thoughts
were upon Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I wondered where she was, and how long
she would stay away.&nbsp; At length becoming tired and listless, I
determined to return to the dingle, and resume the reading of the Bible
at the place where I had left off.&nbsp; &ldquo;What better could I
do,&rdquo; methought, &ldquo;on a Sunday evening?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
then near the wood which surrounded the dingle, but at that side which
was farthest from the encampment, which stood near the entrance.&nbsp;
Suddenly, on turning round the southern corner of the copse, which surrounded
the dingle, I perceived Ursula seated under a thorn-bush.&nbsp; I thought
I never saw her look prettier than then, dressed as she was, in her
Sunday&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>&ldquo;Good
evening, Ursula,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I little thought to have the
pleasure of seeing you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor would you, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;had not
Jasper told me that you had been talking about me, and wanted to speak
to me under a hedge; so hearing that, I watched your motions, and came
here and sat down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of going to my quarters in the dingle, to read
the Bible, Ursula, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray then, go to your quarters, brother, and read the
Miduveleskoe lil; <a name="citation293"></a><a href="#footnote293">{293}</a>
you can speak to me under a hedge some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will sit down with you, Ursula; for, after all,
reading godly books in dingles at eve is rather sombre work.&nbsp; Yes,
I think I will sit down with you;&rdquo; and I sat down by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, now you have sat down with me under the hedge,
what have you to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I hardly know, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not know, brother; a pretty fellow you to ask young women
to come and sit with you under hedges, and, when they come, not know
what to say to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ah!&nbsp; I remember; do you know, Ursula, that I take
a great interest in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, brother; kind of you, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be exposed to a great many temptations, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many indeed, brother.&nbsp; It is hard to see fine
things, such as shawls, gold watches, and chains in the shops, behind
the big glasses, and to know <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>that
they are not intended for one.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time I have been
tempted to make a dash at them; but I bethought myself that by so doing
I should cut my hands, besides being almost certain of being grabbed
and sent across the gull&rsquo;s bath to the foreign country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think gold and fine things temptations, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, brother, very great temptations; don&rsquo;t you
think them so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then more fool you, brother; but have the kindness to tell
me what you would call a temptation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for example, the hope of honour and renown, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hope of honour and renown! very good, brother: but I tell
you one thing, that unless you have money in your pocket, and good broadcloth
on your back, you are not likely to obtain much honour and&mdash;what
do you call it? amongst the gorgios, to say nothing of the Romany chals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought, Ursula, that the Romany chals, roaming
about the world as they do, free and independent, were above being led
by such trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know nothing of the gypsies, brother; no people on
earth are fonder of those trifles, as you call them, than the Romany
chals, or more disposed to respect those who have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then money and fine clothes would induce you to do anything,
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother, anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>&ldquo;To
chore, <a name="citation295a"></a><a href="#footnote295a">{295a}</a>

<p>&ldquo;Like enough, brother; gypsies have been transported before
now for choring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hokkawar?&rdquo; <a name="citation295b"></a><a href="#footnote295b">{295b}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; I was telling dukkerin only yesterday, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, to break the law in everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, brother, who knows? as I said before, gold and
fine clothes are great temptations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, I am sorry for it, I should never have thought
you so depraved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that I am seated by one who is willing to&mdash;to
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To play the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the lubbeny.&rdquo; <a name="citation295c"></a><a href="#footnote295c">{295c}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The what, brother?&rdquo; said Ursula, starting from her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the lubbeny; don&rsquo;t you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, looking somewhat
pale, and speaking very low, &ldquo;if I had only something in my hand,
I would do you a mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>&ldquo;Why,
what is the matter, Ursula?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;how have I offended
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you offended me?&nbsp; Why, didn&rsquo;t you insinivate
just now that I was ready to play the&mdash;the . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the . . . I&rsquo;ll not say it; but I only wish
I had something in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have offended, Ursula, I am very sorry for it; any offence
I may have given you was from want of understanding you.&nbsp; Come,
pray be seated, I have much to question you about&mdash;to talk to you
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seated, not I!&nbsp; It was only just now that you gave me
to understand that you was ashamed to be seated by me, a thief, a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you not almost give me to understand that you were
both, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care being called a thief and a liar,&rdquo;
said Ursula; &ldquo;a person may be a liar and a thief, and yet a very
honest woman, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, brother, if you ever sinivate again that
I could be the third thing, so help me duvel! <a name="citation296"></a><a href="#footnote296">{296}</a>
I&rsquo;ll do you a mischief.&nbsp; By my God I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, I assure you that I shall sinivate, as you call
it, nothing of the kind about you.&nbsp; I have no doubt, from what
you have said, that you are a very paragon of virtue&mdash;a perfect
Lucretia; but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Ursula, brother, and not Lucretia: <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>Lucretia
is not of our family, but one of the Bucklands; she travels about Oxfordshire;
yet I am as good as she any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucretia! how odd!&nbsp; Where could she have got that name?&nbsp;
Well, I make no doubt, Ursula, that you are quite as good as she, and
she of her namesake of ancient Rome; but there is a mystery in this
same virtue, Ursula, which I cannot fathom! how a thief and a liar should
be able, or indeed willing, to preserve her virtue is what I don&rsquo;t
understand.&nbsp; You confess that you are very fond of gold.&nbsp;
Now, how is it that you don&rsquo;t barter your virtue for gold sometimes?&nbsp;
I am a philosopher, Ursula, and like to know everything.&nbsp; You must
be every now and then exposed to great temptation, Ursula: for you are
of a beauty calculated to captivate all hearts.&nbsp; Come, sit down
and tell me how you are enabled to resist such temptation as gold and
fine clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;as you say you mean
no harm, I will sit down beside you, and enter into discourse with you;
but I will uphold that you are the coolest hand that I ever came nigh,
and say the coolest things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon Ursula sat down by my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, we will, if you please, discourse on the subject
of your temptations.&nbsp; I suppose that you travel very much about,
and show yourself in all kinds of places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all kinds, brother; I travels, as you say, very much, attends
fairs and races, and enters booths and <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>public-houses,
where I tells fortunes, and sometimes dances and sings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do not people often address you in a very free manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frequently, brother; and I give them tolerably free answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do people ever offer to make you presents?&nbsp; I mean presents
of value, such as . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silk handkerchiefs, shawls, and trinkets; very frequently,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you do, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take what people offers me, brother, and stows it away as
soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but don&rsquo;t people expect something for their presents?&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t mean dukkerin, dancing, and the like; but such a moderate
and innocent thing as a choomer, <a name="citation298"></a><a href="#footnote298">{298}</a>
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innocent thing, do you call it, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world calls it so, Ursula.&nbsp; Well, do the people who
give you the fine things never expect a choomer in return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very frequently, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you ever grant it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you avoid it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gets away as soon as possible, brother.&nbsp; If they follows
me, I tries to baffle them, by means of jests and laughter; and if they
persist, I uses bad and terrible language, of which I have plenty in
store.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>&ldquo;But
if your terrible language has no effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I screams for the constable, and if he comes not, I uses
my teeth and nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they always sufficient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only had to use them twice, brother; but then I found
them sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the person who followed you was highly agreeable,
Ursula?&nbsp; A handsome young officer of local militia, for example,
all dressed in Lincoln green, would you still refuse him the choomer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We makes no difference, brother! the daughters of the gypsy-father
makes no difference; and, what&rsquo;s more, sees none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, the world will hardly give you credit for such
indifference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cares we for the world, brother! we are not of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your fathers, brothers, and uncles give you credit I suppose,
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother, our fathers, brothers, and cokos <a name="citation299a"></a><a href="#footnote299a">{299a}</a>
gives us all manner of credit; for example, I am telling lies and dukkerin
in a public-house where my batu <a name="citation299b"></a><a href="#footnote299b">{299b}</a>
or coko&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;are playing on the fiddle; well, my
batu and my coko beholds me amongst the public-house crew, talking nonsense
and hearing nonsense; but they are under no apprehension; and presently
they sees the good-looking officer of militia, in his greens and Lincolns,
get up and give me a wink, and I go out with him abroad, into the dark

perhaps; well, my batu and coko goes on fiddling, just as if I were
six miles off asleep in the tent, and not out in the dark street with
the local officer, with his Lincolns and his greens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know they can trust you, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother; and, what&rsquo;s more, I knows I can trust
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would merely go out to make a fool of him, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely go out to make a fool of him, brother, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such proceedings really have an odd look, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst gorgios, very so, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be rather unpleasant to lose one&rsquo;s character
even amongst gorgios, Ursula; and suppose the officer, out of revenge
for being tricked and duped by you, were to say of you the thing that
is not, were to meet you on the race-course the next day, and boast
of receiving favours which he never had, amidst a knot of jeering militia-men,
how would you proceed, Ursula? would you not be abashed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, brother; I should bring my action of law against
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your action at law, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother; I should give a whistle, whereupon all one&rsquo;s
cokos and batus, and all my near and distant relations, would leave
their fiddling, dukkerin, and horse-dealing, and come flocking about
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Ursula?&rsquo; says my coko.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; I <!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>replies,
&lsquo;save and except that gorgio, in his greens and his Lincolns,
says that I have played the . . . with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oho,
he does, Ursula,&rsquo; says my coko; &lsquo;try your action of law
against him, my lamb,&rsquo; and he puts something privily into my hands;
whereupon I goes close up to the grinning gorgio, and staring him in
the face, with my head pushed forward, I cries out: &lsquo;You say I
did what was wrong with you last night when I was out with you abroad?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says the local officer, &lsquo;I says you did,&rsquo;
looking down all the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a liar,&rsquo; says
I, and forthwith I breaks his head with the stick which I holds behind
me, and which my coko has conveyed privily into my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is your action at law, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, this is my action at club-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would your breaking the fellow&rsquo;s head quite clear
you of all suspicion in the eyes of your batus, cokos, <a name="citation301"></a><a href="#footnote301">{301}</a>
and what not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would never suspect me at all, brother, because they
would know that I would never condescend to be over intimate with a
gorgio; the breaking the head would be merely intended to justify Ursula
in the eyes of the gorgios.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would it clear you in their eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not, brother?&nbsp; When they saw the blood running
down from the fellow&rsquo;s cracked poll on his greens and Lincolns,
they would be quite satisfied; why, the fellow would not be able to
show his face at fair or merry-making for a year and three quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>&ldquo;Did
you ever try it, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I ever did, brother, but it would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you ever learn such a method of proceeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;tis advised by gypsy liri, <a name="citation302a"></a><a href="#footnote302a">{302a}</a>
brother.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s part of our way of settling difficulties amongst
ourselves; for example, if a young Roman were to say the thing which
is not respecting Ursula and himself, Ursula would call a great meeting
of the people, who would all sit down in a ring, the young fellow amongst
them; a coko would then put a stick in Ursula&rsquo;s hand, who would
then get up and go to the young fellow, and say, &lsquo;Did I play the
. . . with you?&rsquo; and were he to say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she would
crack his head before the eyes of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Ursula, I was bred an apprentice
to gorgio law, and of course ought to stand up for it, whenever I conscientiously
can, but I must say the gypsy manner of bringing an action for defamation
is much less tedious, and far more satisfactory, than the gorgiko one.&nbsp;
I wish you now to clear up a certain point which is rather mysterious
to me.&nbsp; You say that for a Romany chi to do what is unseemly with
a gorgio is quite out of the question, yet only the other day I heard
you singing a song in which a Romany chi confesses herself to be cambri
<a name="citation302b"></a><a href="#footnote302b">{302b}</a> by a grand
gorgious gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sad let down,&rdquo; said Ursula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;sad or not, there&rsquo;s the
song that <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>speaks
of the thing, which you give me to understand is not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the thing ever was,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;it
was a long time ago, and perhaps, after all, not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you sing the song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, brother: we sings the song now and then to be
a warning to ourselves to have as little to do as possible in the way
of acquaintance with the gorgios; and a warning it is.&nbsp; You see
how the young woman in the song was driven out of her tent by her mother,
with all kinds of disgrace and bad language; but you don&rsquo;t know
that she was afterwards buried alive by her cokos and pals, in an uninhabited
place.&nbsp; The song doesn&rsquo;t say it, but the story says it; for
there is a story about it, though, as I said before, it was a long time
ago, and perhaps, after all, wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if such a thing were to happen at present, would the cokos
and pals bury the girl alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what they would do,&rdquo; said Ursula,
&ldquo;I suppose they are not so strict as they were long ago; at any
rate she would be driven from the tan, <a name="citation303"></a><a href="#footnote303">{303}</a>
and avoided by all her family and relations as a gorgio&rsquo;s acquaintance,
so that, perhaps, at last, she would be glad if they would bury her
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can conceive that there would be an objection on the
part of the cokos and batus that a Romany chi should form an improper
acquaintance with a gorgio, but I should think that the batus and cokos
could <!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>hardly
object to the chi&rsquo;s entering into the honourable estate of wedlock
with a gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ursula was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage is an honourable estate, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, suppose it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a Romany chi should object to enter
into the honourable estate of wedlock with a gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, brother; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and, moreover, I am aware, notwithstanding
your evasion, Ursula, that marriages and connections now and then occur
between gorgios and Romany chies; the result of which is the mixed breed,
called half-and-half, which is at present travelling about England,
and to which the Flaming Tinman belongs, otherwise called Anselo Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the half-and-halfs,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;they
are a bad set; and there is not a worse blackguard in England than Anselo
Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All what you say may be very true, Ursula, but you admit that
there are half-and-halfs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more&rsquo;s the pity, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity or not, you admit the fact; but how do you account for
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I account for it? why, I will tell you, by the break
up of a Roman family, brother,&mdash;the father of a small family dies,
and perhaps the mother; and the poor children are left behind; sometimes
they are gathered up by their relations, and sometimes, if they have
none, by charitable Romans, who bring <!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>them
up in the observance of gypsy law; but sometimes they are not so lucky,
and falls into the company of gorgios, trampers, and basket-makers,
who live in caravans, with whom they take up, and so . . . I hate to
talk of the matter, brother; but so comes this race of the half-and-halfs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to say, Ursula, that no Romany chi, unless compelled
by hard necessity, would have anything to do with a gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not over fond of gorgios, brother, and we hates basket-makers
and folks that live in caravans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;suppose a gorgio, who is not a
basket-maker, a fine handsome gorgious gentleman, who lives in a fine
house . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not fond of houses, brother.&nbsp; I never slept in
a house in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would not plenty of money induce you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate houses, brother, and those who live in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose such a person were willing to resign his fine
house, and, for love of you, to adopt gypsy law, speak Romany, and live
in a tan, <a name="citation305"></a><a href="#footnote305">{305}</a>
would you have nothing to say to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bringing plenty of money with him, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bringing plenty of money with him, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, suppose you produce your man; where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely supposing such a person, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know of such a person, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Ursula; why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>&ldquo;Because,
brother, I was almost beginning to think that you meant yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself, Ursula!&nbsp; I have no fine house to resign; nor
have I money.&nbsp; Moreover, Ursula, though I have a great regard for
you, and though I consider you very handsome, quite as handsome, indeed,
as Meridiana in . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meridiana! where did you meet with her?&rdquo; said Ursula,
with a toss of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in old Pulci&rsquo;s . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At old Fulcher&rsquo;s! that&rsquo;s not true brother.&nbsp;
Meridiana is a Borzlam, and travels with her own people, and not with
old Fulcher, <a name="citation306"></a><a href="#footnote306">{306}</a>
who is a gorgio and a basket-maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not speaking of old Fulcher, but Pulci, a great Italian
writer, who lived many hundred years ago, and who, in his poem called
the &lsquo;Morgante Maggiore,&rsquo; speaks of Meridiana, the daughter
of . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Carus Borzlam,&rdquo; said Ursula; &ldquo;but if the fellow
you mention lived so many hundred years ago, how, in the name of wonder,
could he know anything of Meridiana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wonder, Ursula, is, how your people could ever have got
hold of that name, and similar ones.&nbsp; The Meridiana of Pulci was
not the daughter of old Carus Borzlam, but of Caradoro, a great pagan
king of the East, who, being besieged in his capital by Manfredonio,
<!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>another
mighty pagan king, who wished to obtain possession of his daughter,
who had refused him, was relieved in his distress by certain paladins
of Charlemagne, with one of whom, Oliver, his daughter Meridiana fell
in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;that it must have been altogether
a different person, for I am sure that Meridiana Borzlam would never
have fallen in love with Oliver.&nbsp; Oliver! why, that is the name
of the curo-mengro who lost the fight near the chong gav, <a name="citation307"></a><a href="#footnote307">{307}</a>
the day of the great tempest, when I got wet through.&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp;
Meridiana Borzlam would never have so far forgot her blood as to take
up with Tom Oliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not talking of that Oliver, Ursula, but of Oliver, peer
of France, and paladin of Charlemagne, with whom Meridiana, daughter
of Caradore, fell in love, and for whose sake she renounced her religion
and became a Christian, and finally ingravidata, or cambri, by him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;E nacquene un figliuol, dice la storia,<br />
Che dette &agrave; Carlo-man poi gran vittoria.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which means . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what it means,&rdquo; said Ursula;
&ldquo;no good, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Well, if the Meridiana of Charles&rsquo;s
wain&rsquo;s pal was no handsomer than Meridiana Borzlam, she was no
great catch, brother; for though I am by no means given to vanity, I
think myself better to look <!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>at
than she, though I will say she is no lubbeny, and would scorn . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no doubt she would, Ursula, and I make no doubt that
you are much handsomer than she, or even the Meridiana of Oliver.&nbsp;
What I was about to say, before you interrupted me, is this, that though
I have a great regard for you, and highly admire you, it is only in
a brotherly way, and . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had nothing better to say to me,&rdquo; said Ursula,
&ldquo;when you wanted to talk to me beneath a hedge, than that you
liked me in a brotherly way! well, I declare . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem disappointed, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed, brother! not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were just now saying that you disliked gorgios, so, of
course, could only wish that I, who am a gorgio, should like you in
a brotherly way; I wished to have a conversation with you beneath a
hedge, but only with the view of procuring from you some information
respecting the song which you sung the other day, and the conduct of
Roman females, which has always struck me as being highly unaccountable,
so, if you thought anything else . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I expect from a picker-up of old words, brother?&nbsp;
Bah!&nbsp; I dislike a picker-up of old words worse than a picker-up
of old rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Ursula, I feel a great interest in you;
you are very handsome, and very clever; indeed, with your beauty and
cleverness, I only wonder that you have not long since been married.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>&ldquo;You
do, do you, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; However, keep up your spirits, Ursula, you are
not much past the prime of youth, so . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much past the prime of youth!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be uncivil,
brother; I was only twenty-two last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended, Ursula, but twenty-two is twenty-two,
or I should rather say, that twenty-two in a woman is more than twenty-six
in a man.&nbsp; You are still very beautiful, but I advise you to accept
the first offer that&rsquo;s made to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, brother, but your advice comes rather late; I accepted
the first offer that was made me five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You married five years ago, Ursula! is it possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite possible, brother, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came I to know nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How comes it that you don&rsquo;t know many thousand things
about the Romans, brother?&nbsp; Do you think they tell you all their
affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married, Ursula, married! well, I declare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem disappointed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed!&nbsp; Oh, no! not at all; but Jasper, only a
few weeks ago, told me that you were not married; and, indeed, almost
gave me to understand that you would be very glad to get a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believed him?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, brother,
for your instruction, that there is not in the whole world a greater
liar than Jasper Petulengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear it, Ursula; but with respect <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>to
him you married&mdash;who might he be?&nbsp; A gorgio, or a Romany chal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorgio, or Romany chal?&nbsp; Do you think I would ever condescend
to a gorgio?&nbsp; It was a Camomescro, brother, a Lovell, a distant
relation of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is he! and what became of him?&nbsp; Have you any
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am going to tell you all my history, brother;
and, to tell you the truth, I am tired of sitting under hedges with
you, talking nonsense.&nbsp; I shall go to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do sit a little longer, sister Ursula.&nbsp; I most heartily
congratulate you on your marriage.&nbsp; But where is this same Lovell?&nbsp;
I have never seen him: I should wish to congratulate him too.&nbsp;
You are quite as handsome as the Meridiana of Pulci, Ursula, ay, or
the Despina of Ricciardetto.&nbsp; Ricciardetto, Ursula, is a poem written
by one Fortiguerra, about ninety years ago, in imitation of the Morgante
of Pulci.&nbsp; It treats of the wars of Charlemagne and his Paladins
with various barbarous nations, who came to besiege Paris.&nbsp; Despina
was the daughter and heiress of Scricca, King of Cafria; she was the
beloved of Ricciardetto, and was beautiful as an angel; but I make no
doubt you are quite as handsome as she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Ursula&mdash;but the reply of Ursula
I reserve for another chapter, the present having attained to rather
an uncommon length, for which, however, the importance of the matter
discussed is a sufficient apology.</p>
<h2><!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>CHAPTER
XXVII.&mdash;URSULA&rsquo;S TALE&mdash;THE PATTERAN&mdash;THE DEEP WATER&mdash;SECOND
HUSBAND.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, plucking a dandelion which grew
at her feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have always said that a more civil and pleasant-spoken
person than yourself can&rsquo;t be found.&nbsp; I have a great regard
for you and your learning, and am willing to do you any pleasure in
the way of words or conversation.&nbsp; Mine is not a very happy story,
but as you wish to hear it, it is quite at your service.&nbsp; Launcelot
Lovell made me an offer, as you call it, and we were married in Roman
fashion; that is, we gave each other our right hands, and promised to
be true to each other.&nbsp; We lived together two years, travelling
sometimes by ourselves, sometimes with our relations; I bore him two
children, both of which were still-born, partly, I believe, from the
fatigue I underwent in running about the country telling dukkerin when
I was not exactly in a state to do so, and partly from the kicks and
blows which my husband Launcelot was in the habit of giving me every
night, provided I came home with less than five shillings, which it
is sometimes impossible to make in the country, provided no fair or
merry-making is going on.&nbsp; At the end of two years my husband,
Launcelot, whistled a horse from a farmer&rsquo;s field, and sold it
for forty pounds; and for that horse he was taken, put in prison, tried,
and condemned to be sent to the other country for life.&nbsp; Two <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>days
before he was to be sent away, I got leave to see him in the prison,
and in the presence of the turnkey I gave him a thin cake of gingerbread,
in which there was a dainty saw which could cut through iron.&nbsp;
I then took on wonderfully, turned my eyes inside out, fell down in
a seeming fit, and was carried out of the prison.&nbsp; That same night
my husband sawed his irons off, cut through the bars of his window,
and dropping down a height of fifty feet, lighted on his legs, and came
and joined me on a heath where I was camped alone.&nbsp; We were just
getting things ready to be off, when we heard people coming, and sure
enough they were runners after my husband, Launcelot Lovell; for his
escape had been discovered within a quarter of an hour after he had
got away.&nbsp; My husband, without bidding me farewell, set off at
full speed, and they after him, but they could not take him, and so
they came back and took me, and shook me, and threatened me, and had
me before the poknees, <a name="citation312"></a><a href="#footnote312">{312}</a>
who shook his head at me, and threatened me in order to make me discover
where my husband was, but I said I did not know, which was true enough;
not that I would have told him if I had.&nbsp; So at last the poknees
and the runners, not being able to make anything out of me, were obliged
to let me go, and I went in search of my husband.&nbsp; I wandered about
with my cart for several days in the direction in which I saw him run
off, with my eyes bent on the ground, but could see no marks of him;
at last, coming to four cross roads, I saw my husband&rsquo;s patteran.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>&ldquo;You
saw your husband&rsquo;s patteran?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother.&nbsp; Do you know what patteran means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Ursula; the gypsy trail, the handful of grass which
the gypsies strew in the roads as they travel, to give information to
any of their companions who may be behind, as to the route they have
taken.&nbsp; The gypsy patteran has always had a strange interest for
me, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough, brother; but what does patteran mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the gypsy trail, formed as I told you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know nothing more about patteran, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, Ursula; do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name for the leaf of a tree, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s odd enough
that I have asked that question of a dozen Romany chals and chies, and
they always told me that they did not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more they did, brother; there&rsquo;s only one person in
England that knows, and that&rsquo;s myself&mdash;the name for a leaf
is patteran.&nbsp; Now there are two that knows it&mdash;the other is
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Ursula, how very strange!&nbsp; I am much obliged
to you.&nbsp; I think I never saw you look so pretty as you do now;
but who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, Mrs. Herne, told it me one day, brother, when she
was in a good humour, which she very seldom was, and no one has a better
right to know than yourself, <!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>as
she hated you mortally: it was one day when you had been asking our
company what was the word for a leaf, and nobody could tell you, that
she took me aside and told me, for she was in a good humour, and triumphed
in seeing you balked.&nbsp; She told me the word for leaf was patteran,
which our people use now for trail, having forgotten the true meaning.&nbsp;
She said that the trail was called patteran, because the gypsies of
old were in the habit of making the marks with the leaves and branches
of trees, placed in a certain manner.&nbsp; She said that nobody knew
it but herself, who was one of the old sort, and begged me never to
tell the word to any one but him I should marry; and to be particularly
cautious never to let you know it, whom she hated.&nbsp; Well, brother,
perhaps I have done wrong to tell you; but, as I said before, I likes
you, and am always ready to do your pleasure in words and conversation;
my mother, moreover, is dead and gone, and, poor thing, will never know
anything about the matter.&nbsp; So, when I married, I told my husband
about the patteran, and we were in the habit of making our private trail
with leaves and branches of trees, which none of the other gypsy people
did; so, when I saw my husband&rsquo;s patteran, I knew it at once,
and I followed it upwards of two hundred miles towards the north; and
then I came to a deep, awful-looking water, with an overhanging bank,
and on the bank I found the patteran, which directed me to proceed along
the bank towards the east; and I followed my husband&rsquo;s patteran
towards the east, and before I had gone half a mile, I came to a place
where I saw the bank had <!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>given
way, and fallen into the deep water.&nbsp; Without paying much heed,
I passed on, and presently came to a public-house, not far from the
water, and I entered the public-house to get a little beer, and perhaps
to tell a dukkerin, for I saw a great many people about the door; and,
when I entered, I found there was what they calls an inquest being held
upon a body in that house, and the jury had just risen to go and look
at the body; and being a woman, and having a curiosity, I thought I
would go with them, and so I did; and no sooner did I see the body than
I knew it to be my husband&rsquo;s; it was much swelled and altered,
but I knew it partly by the clothes, and partly by a mark on the forehead,
and I cried out, &lsquo;It is my husband&rsquo;s body,&rsquo; and I
fell down in a fit, and the fit that time, brother, was not a seeming
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; I, &ldquo;how terrible! but tell me, Ursula,
how did your husband come by his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank, overhanging the deep water, gave way under him,
brother, and he was drowned; for, like most of our people, he could
not swim, or only a little.&nbsp; The body, after it had been in the
water a long time, came up of itself, and was found floating.&nbsp;
Well, brother, when the people of the neighbourhood found that I was
the wife of the drowned man, they were very kind to me, and made a subscription
for me, with which, after having seen my husband buried, I returned
the way I had come, till I met Jasper and his people, and with them
I have travelled ever since: I was very melancholy for a long time,
I assure you, brother; for the <!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>death
of my husband preyed very much upon my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His death was certainly a very shocking one, Ursula; but,
really, if he had died a natural one, you could scarcely have regretted
it, for he appears to have treated you barbarously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women must bear, brother; and, barring that he kicked and
beat me, and drove me out to tell dukkerin when I could scarcely stand,
he was not a bad husband.&nbsp; A man, by gypsy law, brother, is allowed
to kick and beat his wife, and to bury her alive, if he thinks proper.&nbsp;
I am a gypsy, and have nothing to say against the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has Mikailia Chikno to say about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a cripple, brother, the only cripple amongst the Roman
people: so she is allowed to do and say as she pleases.&nbsp; Moreover,
her husband does not think fit to kick or beat her, though it is my
opinion she would like him all the better if he were occasionally to
do so, and threaten to bury her alive; at any rate, she would treat
him better, and respect him more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister does not seem to stand much in awe of Jasper Petulengro,
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the matters of my sister and Jasper Petulengro alone,
brother; you must travel in their company some time before you can understand
them; they are a strange two, up to all kind of chaffing: but two more
regular Romans don&rsquo;t breathe, and I&rsquo;ll tell you, for your
instruction, that there isn&rsquo;t a better mare-breaker in England
that Jasper Petulengro, if you can manage Miss Isopel Berners as well
as . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>&ldquo;Isopel
Berners,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how came you to think of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I but think of her, brother, living as she does
with you in Mumper&rsquo;s dingle, and travelling about with you; you
will have, brother, more difficulty to manage her, than Jasper has to
manage my sister Pakomovna.&nbsp; I should have mentioned her before,
only I wanted to know what you had to say to me; and when we got into
discourse, I forgot her.&nbsp; I say, brother, let me tell you your
dukkerin, with respect to her, you will never . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me tell you your dukkerin, brother, you will never
manage . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula, in connection with Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; Moreover, it is Sunday, we will change the subject; it
is surprising to me that, after all you have undergone, you should still
look so beautiful.&nbsp; I suppose you do not think of marrying again,
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother, one husband at a time is quite enough for any
reasonable mort; especially such a good husband as I have got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a good husband! why, I thought you told me your husband
was drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, my first husband was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you a second?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he, in the name of wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he? why Sylvester, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>&ldquo;I
do assure you, Ursula, that I feel disposed to be angry with you; such
a handsome young woman as yourself to take up with such a nasty pepper-faced
good-for-nothing . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear my husband abused, brother; so you had
better say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is he not the Lazarus of the gypsies? has he a penny
of his own, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the more his want, brother, of a clever chi like me to
take care of him and his childer.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, I
will chore, <a name="citation318"></a><a href="#footnote318">{318}</a>
if necessary, and tell dukkerin for Sylvester, if even so heavy as scarcely
to be able to stand.&nbsp; You call him lazy; you would not think him
lazy if you were in a ring with him; he is a proper man with his hands:
Jasper is going to back him for twenty pounds against Slammocks of the
Chong gav, the brother of Roarer and Bell-metal; he says he has no doubt
that he will win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you like him, I, of course, can have no objection.&nbsp;
Have you been long married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a fortnight, brother; that dinner, the other day, when
I sang the song, was given in celebration of the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you married in a church, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were not, brother; none but gorgios, cripples, and lubbenys
are ever married in a church; we took each other&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;
Brother, I have been with you near three hours beneath this hedge.&nbsp;
I will go to my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>&ldquo;Does
he know that you are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is he satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied! of course.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, you gorgios!&nbsp;
Brother, I go to my husband and my house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, thereupon,
Ursula rose and departed.</p>
<p>After waiting a little time I also arose; it was now dark, and I
thought I could do no better than betake myself to the dingle; at the
entrance of it I found Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well brother,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;what kind of conversation have you and Ursula had beneath
the hedge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wished to hear what we were talking about, you should
have come and sat down beside us; you knew where we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, I did much the same, for I went and sat down
behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the hedge, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the hedge, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And heard all our conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every word, brother; and a rum conversation it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an old saying, Jasper, that listeners never hear
any good of themselves; perhaps you heard the epithet that Ursula bestowed
upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, by epitaph, you mean that she called me a liar, I did,
brother, and she was not much wrong, for I certainly do not always stick
exactly to truth; you, however, have not much to complain of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deceived me about Ursula, giving me to understand she
was not married.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>&ldquo;She
was not married when I told you so, brother; that is, not to Sylvester;
nor was I aware that she was going to marry him.&nbsp; I once thought
you had a kind of regard for her, and I am sure she had as much for
you as a Romany chi can have for a gorgio.&nbsp; I half expected to
have heard you make love to her behind the hedge, but I begin to think
you care for nothing in this world but old words and strange stories.&nbsp;
Lor&rsquo;, to take a young woman under a hedge, and talk to her as
you did to Ursula; and yet you got everything out of her that you wanted,
with your gammon about old Fulcher and Meridiana.&nbsp; You are a cunning
one, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken, Jasper.&nbsp; I am not cunning.&nbsp;
If people think I am, it is because, being made up of art themselves,
simplicity of character is a puzzle to them.&nbsp; Your women are certainly
extraordinary creatures, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say they were rum animals?&nbsp; Brother, we
Romans shall always stick together as long as they stick fast to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they always will, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say, brother; nothing lasts for ever.&nbsp; Romany
chies are Romany chies still, though not exactly what they were sixty
years ago.&nbsp; My wife, though a rum one, is not Mrs. Herne, brother.&nbsp;
I think she is rather fond of Frenchmen and French discourse.&nbsp;
I tell you what, brother, if ever gypsyism breaks up, it will be owing
to our chies having been bitten by that mad puppy they calls gentility.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>CHAPTER
XXVIII.&mdash;THE DINGLE AT NIGHT&mdash;THE TWO SIDES OF THE QUESTION&mdash;ROMAN
FEMALES&mdash;FILLING THE KETTLE&mdash;THE DREAM&mdash;THE TALL FIGURE.</h2>
<p>I descended to the bottom of the dingle.&nbsp; It was nearly involved
in obscurity.&nbsp; To dissipate the feeling of melancholy which came
over my mind, I resolved to kindle a fire; and having heaped dry sticks
upon my hearth, and added a billet or two, I struck a light and soon
produced a blaze.&nbsp; Sitting down, I fixed my eyes upon the blaze,
and soon fell into a deep meditation.&nbsp; I thought of the events
of the day, the scene at church, and what I had heard at church, the
danger of losing one&rsquo;s soul, the doubts of Jasper Petulengro as
to whether one had a soul.&nbsp; I thought over the various arguments
which I had either heard, or which had come spontaneously to my mind,
for or against the probability of a state of future existence.&nbsp;
They appeared to me to be tolerably evenly balanced.&nbsp; I then thought
that it was at all events taking the safest part to conclude that there
was a soul.&nbsp; It would be a terrible thing, after having passed
one&rsquo;s life in the disbelief of the existence of a soul, to wake
up after death a soul, and to find one&rsquo;s self a lost soul.&nbsp;
Yes, methought I would come to the conclusion that one has a soul.&nbsp;
Choosing the safe side, however, appeared to me to be playing rather
a dastardly part.&nbsp; I had never been an admirer of people who chose
the <!-- page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>safe
side in everything; indeed I had always entertained a thorough contempt
for them.&nbsp; Surely it would be showing more manhood to adopt the
dangerous side, that of disbelief; I almost resolved to do so&mdash;but
yet in a question of so much importance, I ought not to be guided by
vanity.&nbsp; The question was not which was the safe, but the true
side? yet how was I to know which was the true side?&nbsp; Then I thought
of the Bible&mdash;which I had been reading in the morning&mdash;that
spoke of the soul and a future state; but was the Bible true?&nbsp;
I had heard learned and moral men say that it was true, but I had also
heard learned and moral men say that it was not: how was I to decide?&nbsp;
Still that balance of probabilities!&nbsp; If I could but see the way
of truth, I would follow it, if necessary, upon hands and knees; on
that I was determined; but I could not see it.&nbsp; Feeling my brain
begin to turn round, I resolved to think of something else; and forthwith
began to think of what had passed between Ursula and myself in our discourse
beneath the hedge.</p>
<p>I mused deeply on what she had told me as to the virtue of the females
of her race.&nbsp; How singular that virtue must be which was kept pure
and immaculate by the possessor, whilst indulging in habits of falsehood
and dishonesty.&nbsp; I had always thought the gypsy females extraordinary
beings.&nbsp; I had often wondered at them, their dress, their manner
of speaking, and, not least, at their names; but, until the present
day, I had been unacquainted with the most extraordinary <!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>point
connected with them.&nbsp; How came they possessed of this extraordinary
virtue? was it because they were thievish?&nbsp; I remembered that an
ancient thief-taker, who had retired from his useful calling, and who
frequently visited the office of my master at law, the respectable S.
. ., who had the management of his property&mdash;I remembered to have
heard this worthy, with whom I occasionally held discourse, philosophic
and profound, when he and I chanced to be alone together in the office,
say that all first-rate thieves were sober, and of well-regulated morals,
their bodily passions being kept in abeyance by their love of gain;
but this axiom could scarcely hold good with respect to these women&mdash;however
thievish they might be, they did care for something besides gain: they
cared for their husbands.&nbsp; If they did thieve, they merely thieved
for their husbands; and though, perhaps, some of them were vain, they
merely prized their beauty because it gave them favour in the eyes of
their husbands.&nbsp; Whatever the husbands were&mdash;and Jasper had
almost insinuated that the males occasionally allowed themselves some
latitude&mdash;they appeared to be as faithful to their husbands as
the ancient Roman matrons were to theirs.&nbsp; Roman matrons! and,
after all, might not these be in reality Roman matrons?&nbsp; They called
themselves Romans; might not they be the descendants of the old Roman
matrons?&nbsp; Might not they be of the same blood as Lucretia?&nbsp;
And were not many of their strange names&mdash;Lucretia amongst the
rest&mdash;handed down to them from old <!-- page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>Rome?&nbsp;
It is true their language was not that of old Rome; it was not, however,
altogether different from it.&nbsp; After all, the ancient Romans might
be a tribe of these people, who settled down and founded a village with
the tilts of carts, which by degrees, and the influx of other people,
became the grand city of the world.&nbsp; I liked the idea of the grand
city of the world owing its origin to a people who had been in the habit
of carrying their houses in their carts.&nbsp; Why, after all, should
not the Romans of history be a branch of these Romans?&nbsp; There were
several points of similarity between them; if Roman matrons were chaste,
both men and women were thieves.&nbsp; Old Rome was the thief of the
world; yet still there were difficulties to be removed before I could
persuade myself that the old Romans and my Romans were identical; and
in trying to remove these difficulties, I felt my brain once more beginning
to turn, and in haste took up another subject of meditation, and that
was the patteran, and what Ursula had told me about it.</p>
<p>I had always entertained a strange interest for that sign by which
in their wanderings the Romanese gave to those of their people who came
behind intimation as to the direction which they took; but it now inspired
me with greater interest than ever,&mdash;now that I had learned that
the proper meaning of it was the leaves of trees.&nbsp; I had, as I
had said in my dialogue with Ursula, been very eager to learn the word
for leaf in the Romanian language, but had never learned it till this
day; so patteran signified leaf, the leaf of a tree; <!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>and
no one at present knew that but myself and Ursula, who had learned it
from Mrs. Herne, the last, it was said, of the old stock; and then I
thought what strange people the gypsies must have been in the old time.
They were sufficiently strange at present, but they must have been far
stranger of old; they must have been a more peculiar people&mdash;their
language must have been more perfect&mdash;and they must have had a
greater stock of strange secrets.&nbsp; I almost wished that I had lived
some two or three hundred years ago, that I might have observed these
people when they were yet stranger than at present.&nbsp; I wondered
whether I could have introduced myself to their company at that period,
whether I should have been so fortunate as to meet such a strange, half-malicious,
half good-humoured being as Jasper, who would have instructed me in
the language, then more deserving of note than at present.&nbsp; What
might I not have done with that language, had I known it in its purity?&nbsp;
Why, I might have written books in it; yet those who spoke it would
hardly have admitted me to their society at that period, when they kept
more to themselves.&nbsp; Yet I thought that I might possibly have gained
their confidence, and have wandered about with them, and learned their
language, and all their strange ways, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;and
a sigh rose from the depth of my breast; for I began to think, &ldquo;Supposing
I had accomplished all this, what would have been the profit of it?
and in what would all this wild gypsy dream have terminated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then rose another sigh, yet more profound, for I <!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>began
to think, &ldquo;What was likely to be the profit of my present way
of life; the living in dingles, making pony and donkey shoes, conversing
with gypsy-women under hedges, and extracting from them their odd secrets?&rdquo;&nbsp;
What was likely to be the profit of such a kind of life, even should
it continue for a length of time?&mdash;a supposition not very probable,
for I was earning nothing to support me, and the funds with which I
had entered upon this life were gradually disappearing.&nbsp; I was
living, it is true, not unpleasantly, enjoying the healthy air of heaven;
but, upon the whole, was I not sadly misspending my time?&nbsp; Surely
I was; and, as I looked back, it appeared to me that I had always been
doing so.&nbsp; What had been the profit of the tongues which I had
learned? had they ever assisted me in the day of hunger?&nbsp; No, no!
it appeared to me that I had always misspent my time, save in one instance,
when by a desperate effort I had collected all the powers of my imagination,
and written the &ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell&rdquo; <a name="citation326"></a><a href="#footnote326">{326}</a>;
but even when I wrote the Life of Sell, was I not in a false position?&nbsp;
Provided I had not misspent my time, would it have been necessary to
make that effort, which, after all, had only enabled me to leave London,
and wander about the country for a time?&nbsp; But could I, taking <!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>all
circumstances into consideration, have done better than I had?&nbsp;
With my peculiar temperament and ideas, could I have pursued with advantage
the profession to which my respectable parents had endeavoured to bring
me up?&nbsp; It appeared to me that I could not, and that the hand of
necessity had guided me from my earliest years, until the present night
in which I found myself seated in the dingle, staring on the brands
of the fire.&nbsp; But ceasing to think of the past which, as irrecoverably
gone, it was useless to regret, even were there cause to regret it,
what should I do in future?&nbsp; Should I write another book like the
&ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell,&rdquo; take it to London, and offer it to
a publisher?&nbsp; But when I reflected on the grisly sufferings which
I had undergone whilst engaged in writing the &ldquo;Life of Sell,&rdquo;
I shrank from the idea of a similar attempt; moreover, I doubted whether
I possessed the power to write a similar work&mdash;whether the materials
for the life of another Sell lurked within the recesses of my brain?&nbsp;
Had I not better become in reality what I had hitherto been merely playing
at&mdash;a tinker or a gypsy?&nbsp; But I soon saw that I was not fitted
to become either in reality.&nbsp; It was much more agreeable to play
the gypsy or the tinker, than to become either in reality.&nbsp; I had
seen enough of gypsying and tinkering to be convinced of that.&nbsp;
All of a sudden the idea of tilling the soil came into my head; tilling
the soil was a healthful and noble pursuit! but my idea of tilling the
soil had no connection with Britain; for I could only expect to till
the soil in Britain as a serf.&nbsp; <!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>I
thought of tilling it in America, in which it was said there was plenty
of wild, unclaimed land, of which any one, who chose to clear it of
its trees, might take possession.&nbsp; I figured myself in America,
in an immense forest, clearing the land destined, by my exertions, to
become a fruitful and smiling plain.&nbsp; Methought I heard the crash
of the huge trees as they fell beneath my axe; and then I bethought
me that a man was intended to marry&mdash;I ought to marry; and if I
married, where was I likely to be more happy as a husband and a father
than in America, engaged in tilling the ground?&nbsp; I fancied myself
in America, engaged in tilling the ground, assisted by an enormous progeny.&nbsp;
Well, why not marry, and go and till the ground in America?&nbsp; I
was young, and youth was the time to marry in, and to labour in.&nbsp;
I had the use of all my faculties; my eyes, it is true, were rather
dull from early study, and from writing the &ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell&rdquo;;
but I could see tolerably well with them, and they were not bleared.&nbsp;
I felt my arms, and thighs, and teeth&mdash;they were strong and sound
enough; so now was the time to labour, to marry, eat strong flesh, and
beget strong children&mdash;the power of doing all this would pass away
with youth, which was terribly transitory.&nbsp; I bethought me that
a time would come when my eyes would be bleared, and, perhaps, sightless;
my arms and thighs strengthless and sapless; when my teeth would shake
in my jaws, even supposing they did not drop out.&nbsp; No going a wooing
then&mdash;no labouring&mdash;no eating strong flesh, and begetting
lusty children then; and I bethought me how, <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>when
all this should be, 1 should bewail the days of my youth as misspent,
provided I had not in them founded for myself a home, and begotten strong
children to take care of me in the days when I could not take care of
myself; and thinking of these things, I became sadder and sadder, and
stared vacantly upon the fire till my eyes closed in a doze.</p>
<p>I continued dozing over the fire, until rousing myself I perceived
that the brands were nearly consumed, and I thought of retiring for
the night.&nbsp; I arose, and was about to enter my tent, when a thought
struck me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;that Isopel
Berners should return in the midst of the night, how dark and dreary
would the dingle appear without a fire! truly, I will keep up the fire,
and I will do more; I have no board to spread for her, but I will fill
the kettle, and heat it, so that if she comes, I may be able to welcome
her with a cup of tea, for I know she loves tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon,
I piled more wood upon the fire, and soon succeeded in producing a better
blaze than before; then, taking the kettle, I set out for the spring.&nbsp;
On arriving at the mouth of the dingle, which fronted the east, I perceived
that Charles&rsquo;s wain was nearly opposite to it, high above in the
heavens, by which I knew that the night was tolerably well advanced.&nbsp;
The gypsy encampment lay before me; all was hushed and still within
it, and its inmates appeared to be locked in slumber; as I advanced,
however, the dogs, which were fastened outside the tents, growled and
barked; but presently recognising me, they were again silent, <!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>some
of them wagging their tails.&nbsp; As I drew near a particular tent,
I heard a female voice say&mdash;&ldquo;Some one is coming!&rdquo; and,
as I was about to pass it, the cloth which formed the door was suddenly
lifted up, and a black head and part of a huge naked body protruded.&nbsp;
It was the head and upper part of the giant Tawno, who, according to
the fashion of gypsy men, lay next the door, wrapped in his blanket;
the blanket had, however, fallen off, and the starlight shone clear
on his athletic tawny body, and was reflected from his large staring
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only I, Tawno,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;going to fill the
kettle, as it is possible that Miss Berners may arrive this night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kos-ko,&rdquo; <a name="citation330"></a><a href="#footnote330">{330}</a>
drawled out Tawno, and replaced the curtain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good, do you
call it?&rdquo; said the sharp voice of his wife; &ldquo;there is no
good in the matter; if that young chap were not living with the rawnee
in the illegal and uncertificated line, he would not be getting up in
the middle of the night to fill her kettles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Passing on,
I proceeded to the spring, where I filled the kettle, and then returned
to the dingle.</p>
<p>Placing the kettle upon the fire, I watched it till it began to boil;
then removing it from the top of the brands, I placed it close beside
the fire, and leaving it simmering, I retired to my tent; where, having
taken off my shoes, and a few of my garments, I lay down on my palliasse,
and was not long in falling asleep.&nbsp; I believe I slept soundly
for some time, thinking and <!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>dreaming
of nothing: suddenly, however, my sleep became disturbed, and the subject
of the patterans began to occupy my brain.&nbsp; I imagined that I saw
Ursula tracing her husband, Launcelot Lovell, by means of his patterans;
I imagined that she had considerable difficulty in doing so; that she
was occasionally interrupted by parish beadles and constables, who asked
her whither she was travelling, to whom she gave various answers.&nbsp;
Presently methought that, as she was passing by a farm-yard, two fierce
and savage dogs flew at her; I was in great trouble, I remember, and
wished to assist her, but could not, for though I seemed to see her,
I was still at a distance: and now it appeared that she had escaped
from the dogs, and was proceeding with her cart along a gravelly path
which traversed a wild moor; I could hear the wheels grating amidst
sand and gravel.&nbsp; The next moment I was awake, and found myself
sitting up in my tent; there was a glimmer of light through the canvas
caused by the fire; a feeling of dread came over me, which was perhaps
natural, on starting suddenly from one&rsquo;s sleep in that wild lone
place; I half imagined that some one was nigh the tent; the idea made
me rather uncomfortable, and to dissipate it I lifted up the canvas
of the door and peeped out, and, lo! I had an indistinct view of a tall
figure standing by the tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said I,
whilst I felt my blood rush to my heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo;
said the voice of Isopel Berners; &ldquo;you little expected me, I dare
say; well, sleep on, I do not wish to disturb you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I was expecting you,&rdquo; said I, recovering <!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>myself,
&ldquo;as you may see by the fire and the kettle.&nbsp; I will be with
you in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting on in haste the articles of dress which I had flung off,
I came out of the tent, and addressing myself to Isopel, who was standing
beside her cart, I said&mdash;&ldquo;Just as I was about to retire to
rest I thought it possible that you might come to-night, and got everything
in readiness for you.&nbsp; Now, sit down by the fire whilst I lead
the donkey and cart to the place where you stay; I will unharness the
animal, and presently come and join you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I need
not trouble you,&rdquo; said Isopel; &ldquo;I will go myself and see
after my things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We will go together,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and then return and have some tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isopel made
no objection, and in about half-an-hour we had arranged everything at
her quarters.&nbsp; I then hastened and prepared tea.&nbsp; Presently
Isopel rejoined me, bringing her stool; she had divested herself of
her bonnet, and her hair fell over her shoulders; she sat down, and
I poured out the beverage, handing her a cup.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you
made a long journey to-night?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very long
one,&rdquo; replied Belle, &ldquo;I have come nearly twenty miles since
six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe I heard you coming
in my sleep,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;did the dogs above bark at you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Isopel, &ldquo;very violently; did you think
of me in your sleep?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I
was thinking of Ursula and something she had told me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When
and where was that?&rdquo; said Isopel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yesterday evening,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;beneath the dingle hedge.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you
were talking with her beneath the hedge?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;but only upon <!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>gypsy
matters.&nbsp; Do you know, Belle, that she has just been married to
Sylvester, so you need not think that she and I . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She
and you are quite at liberty to sit where you please,&rdquo; said Isopel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However, young man,&rdquo; she continued, dropping her tone,
which she had slightly raised, &ldquo;I believe what you said, that
you were merely talking about gypsy matters, and also what you were
going to say, if it was, as I suppose, that she and you had no particular
acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isopel was now silent for some time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo;
said Belle, &ldquo;how exceedingly kind it was of you to get everything
in readiness for me, though you did not know that I should come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had a presentiment that you would come,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
you forget that I have prepared the kettle for you before, though it
was true I was then certain that you would come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
had not forgotten your doing so, young man,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but
I was beginning to think that you were utterly selfish, caring for nothing
but the gratification of your own strange whims.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am very fond of having my own way,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but utterly
selfish I am not, as I dare say I shall frequently prove to you.&nbsp;
You will often find the kettle boiling when you come home.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not heated by you,&rdquo; said Isopel, with a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
whom else?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;surely you are not thinking of driving
me away?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have as much right here as myself,&rdquo;
said Isopel, &ldquo;as I have told you before; but I must be going myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we can go together; to tell you the
truth, I am rather tired of this place.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Our paths
must be separate,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; <!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>&ldquo;Separate,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;what do you mean?&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let you go alone,
I shall go with you; and you know the road is as free to me as to you;
besides, you can&rsquo;t think of parting company with me, considering
how much you would lose by doing so; remember that you scarcely know
anything of the Armenian language; now, to learn Armenian from me would
take you twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle faintly smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;take
another cup of tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle took another cup of tea, and
yet another; we had some indifferent conversation, after which I arose
and gave her donkey a considerable feed of corn.&nbsp; Belle thanked
me, shook me by the hand, and then went to her own tabernacle, and I
returned to mine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;VISIT TO THE LANDLORD&mdash;HIS MORTIFICATIONS&mdash;HUNTER
AND HIS CLAN&mdash;RESOLUTION.</h2>
<p>On the following morning, after breakfasting with Belle, who was
silent and melancholy, I left her in the dingle, and took a stroll amongst
the neighbouring lanes.&nbsp; After some time I thought I would pay
a visit to the landlord of the public-house, whom I had not seen since
the day when he communicated to me his intention of changing his religion.&nbsp;
I therefore directed my steps to the house, and on entering it found
the landlord standing in the kitchen.&nbsp; Just then two mean-looking
fellows, who had <!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>been
drinking at one of the tables, and who appeared to be the only customers
in the house, got up, brushed past the landlord, and saying in a surly
tone &ldquo;We shall pay you some time or other,&rdquo; took their departure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they serve me now,&rdquo; said the landlord,
with a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know those fellows,&rdquo; I demanded,
&ldquo;since you let them go away in your debt?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know nothing about them,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;save that
they are a couple of scamps.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why did you let
them go away without paying you?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had not
the heart to stop them,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;and, to tell
you the truth, everybody serves me so now, and I suppose they are right,
for a child could flog me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;behave more like a man, and with respect to those two fellows
run after them, I will go with you, and if they refuse to pay the reckoning
I will help you to shake some money out of their clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;but as they are gone,
let them go on.&nbsp; What they have drank is not of much consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; said I, staring at the landlord,
who appeared strangely altered; his features were wild and haggard,
his formerly bluff cheeks were considerably sunken in, and his figure
had lost much of its plumpness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you changed your religion
already, and has the fellow in black commanded you to fast?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have not changed my religion yet,&rdquo; said the landlord,
with a kind of shudder; &ldquo;I am to change it publicly this day fortnight,
and the idea of doing so&mdash;I do not mind telling you&mdash;preys
much upon my mind; moreover, the noise of the thing has got <!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>abroad,
and everybody is laughing at me, and what&rsquo;s more, coming and drinking
my beer, and going away without paying for it, whilst I feel myself
like one bewitched, wishing but not daring to take my own part.&nbsp;
Confound the fellow in black, I wish I had never seen him! yet what
can I do without him?&nbsp; The brewer swears that unless I pay him
fifty pounds within a fortnight he&rsquo;ll send a distress warrant
into the house, and take all I have.&nbsp; My poor niece is crying in
the room above; and I am thinking of going into the stable and hanging
myself; and perhaps it&rsquo;s the best thing I can do, for it&rsquo;s
better to hang myself before selling my soul than afterwards, as I&rsquo;m
sure I should, like Judas Iscariot, whom my poor niece, who is somewhat
religiously inclined, has been talking to me about.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish I could assist you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;with money, but that
is quite out of my power.&nbsp; However, I can give you a piece of advice.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t change your religion by any means; you can&rsquo;t hope
to prosper if you do; and if the brewer chooses to deal hardly with
you, let him.&nbsp; Everybody would respect you ten times more provided
you allowed yourself to be turned into the roads rather than change
your religion, than if you got fifty pounds for renouncing it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am half inclined to take your advice,&rdquo; said the landlord,
&ldquo;only, to tell you the truth, I feel quite low, without any heart
in me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come into the bar,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
let us have something together&mdash;you need not be afraid of my not
paying for what I order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went into the bar-room, where the landlord and I discussed between
us two bottles of strong ale, which he <!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>said
were part of the last six which he had in his possession.&nbsp; At first
he wished to drink sherry, but I begged him to do no such thing, telling
him that the sherry would do him no good, under the present circumstances;
nor, indeed, to the best of my belief under any, it being of all wines
the one for which I entertained the most contempt.&nbsp; The landlord
allowed himself to be dissuaded, and, after a glass or two of ale, confessed
that sherry was a sickly disagreeable drink, and that he had merely
been in the habit of taking it from an idea he had that it was genteel.&nbsp;
Whilst quaffing our beverage, he gave me an account of the various mortifications
to which he had of late been subject, dwelling with particular bitterness
on the conduct of Hunter, who, he said, came every night and mouthed
him, and afterwards went away without paying for what he had drank or
smoked, in which conduct he was closely imitated by a clan of fellows
who constantly attended him.&nbsp; After spending several hours at the
public-house I departed, not forgetting to pay for the two bottles of
ale.&nbsp; The landlord, before I went, shaking me by the hand, declared
that he had now made up his mind to stick to his religion at all hazards,
the more especially as he was convinced he should derive no good by
giving it up. <a name="citation337"></a><a href="#footnote337">{337}</a></p>
<h2><!-- page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>CHAPTER
XXX.&mdash;PREPARATIONS FOR THE FAIR&mdash;THE LAST LESSON&mdash;THE
VERB SIRIEL.</h2>
<p>It might be about five in the evening when I reached the gypsy encampment.&nbsp;
Here I found Mr. Petulengro, Tawno Chikno, Sylvester, and others, in
a great bustle, clipping and trimming certain ponies and old horses
which they had brought with them.&nbsp; On inquiring of Jasper the reason
of their being so engaged, he informed me that they were getting the
horses ready for a fair, which was to be held on the morrow, at a place
some miles distant, at which they should endeavour to dispose of them,
adding&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps, brother, you will go with us, provided
you have nothing better to do?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not having any particular
engagement, I assured him that I should have great pleasure in being
of the party.&nbsp; It was agreed that we should start early on the
following morning.&nbsp; Thereupon I descended into the dingle.&nbsp;
Belle was sitting before the fire, at which the kettle was boiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Were you waiting for me?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said Belle, &ldquo;I thought that you would come, <!-- page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>and
I waited for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That was very kind,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not half so kind,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as it was
of you to get everything ready for me in the dead of last night, when
there was scarcely a chance of my coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tea-things
were brought forward, and we sat down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you been far?&rdquo;
said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Merely to that public-house,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;to which you directed me on the second day of our acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young men should not make a habit of visiting public-houses,&rdquo;
said Belle, &ldquo;they are bad places.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They may
be so to some people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I do not think the worst
public-house in England could do me any harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps
you are so bad already,&rdquo; said Belle, with a smile, &ldquo;that
it would be impossible to spoil you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How dare you
catch at my words?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;come, I will make you pay for
doing so&mdash;you shall have this evening the longest lesson in Armenian
which I have yet inflicted upon you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may well
say inflicted,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but pray spare me.&nbsp; I
do not wish to hear anything about Armenian, especially this evening.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why this evening?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; Belle made no answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not spare you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;this evening I intend
to make you conjugate an Armenian verb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, be
it so,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;for this evening you shall command.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To command is hramahyel,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ram her
ill, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I do not wish to begin with that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as we have come to the verbs, we will
begin regularly; hramahyel is a verb of the second conjugation.&nbsp;
We will begin with the first.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;First of all tell
me,&rdquo; said Belle, <!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>&ldquo;what
a verb is?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A part of speech,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which,
according to the dictionary, signifies some action or passion; for example,
I command you, or I hate you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have given you no
cause to hate me,&rdquo; said Belle, looking me sorrowfully in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely giving two examples,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
neither was directed at you.&nbsp; In those examples, to command and
hate are verbs.&nbsp; Belle, in Armenian there are four conjugations
of verbs; the first end in al, the second in yel, the third in oul,
and the fourth in il.&nbsp; Now, have you understood me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, indeed, it will all end ill,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or you will make me lose
my patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have already made me nearly lose
mine,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us have no unprofitable interruptions,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The conjugations of the Armenian verbs are neither
so numerous nor so difficult as the declensions of the nouns; hear that,
and rejoice.&nbsp; Come, we will begin with the verb hntal, a verb of
the first conjugation, which signifies to rejoice.&nbsp; Come along:
hntam, I rejoice; hntas, thou rejoicest: why don&rsquo;t you follow,
Belle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t rejoice, whatever you may do,&rdquo;
said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chief difficulty, Belle,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that I find in teaching you the Armenian grammar, proceeds from
your applying to yourself and me every example I give.&nbsp; Rejoice,
in this instance, is merely an example of an Armenian verb of the first
conjugation, and has no more to do with your rejoicing than lal, which
is also a verb of the first conjugation, and which signifies <!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>to
weep, would have to do with your weeping, provided I made you conjugate
it.&nbsp; Come along: hntam.&nbsp; I rejoice; hntas, thou rejoicest;
hnt&agrave;, he rejoices; hntamk, we rejoice: now, repeat those words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;they sound more like
the language of horses than of human beings.&nbsp; Do you take me for
. . .?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; Belle was
silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you going to say mare?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mare! mare! by-the-bye, do you know, Belle, that mare in old
English stands for woman; and that when we call a female an evil mare,
the strict meaning of the term is merely bad woman.&nbsp; So if I were
to call you mare, without prefixing bad, you must not be offended.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I should, though,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was merely
attempting to make you acquainted with a philological fact,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;If mare, which in old English, and likewise in vulgar
English, signifies a woman, sounds the same as mare, which in modern
and polite English signifies a female horse, I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp;
There is no such confusion of sounds in Armenian, not, at least, in
the same instance.&nbsp; Belle, in Armenian, woman is ghin, the same
word, by-the-bye, as our queen, whereas mare is madagh tzi, which signifies
a female horse; and perhaps you will permit me to add, that a hard-mouthed
jade is, in Armenian, madagh tzi hsdierah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this much longer,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Keep yourself quiet,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I wish to be gentle
with you; and to convince you, we will skip hntal, and also for the
present verbs of the first conjugation, and proceed to the second.&nbsp;
Belle, I will now select for you to <!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>conjugate
the prettiest verb in Armenian; not only of the second, but also of
all the four conjugations; that verb is siriel.&nbsp; Here is the present
tense:&mdash;siriem, siries, sir&egrave;, siriemk, sir&egrave;k, sirien.&nbsp;
You observe that it runs on just in the same manner as hntal, save and
except that e is substituted for a; and it will be as well to tell you
that almost the only difference between the second, third, and fourth
conjugations, and the first, is the substituting in the present, preterite,
and other tenses e, or ou, or i for a; so you see that the Armenian
verbs are by no means difficult.&nbsp; Come on, Belle, and say siriem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Belle hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray oblige me, Belle, by saying siriem!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Belle still appeared to hesitate.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must admit, Belle,
that it is much softer than hntam.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo;
said Belle; &ldquo;and to oblige you, I will say siriem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very well indeed, Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;No vartabied,
or doctor, could have pronounced it better; and now, to show you how
verbs act upon pronouns in Armenian, I will say siriem zkiez.&nbsp;
Please to repeat siriem zkiez!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Siriem zkiez!&rdquo;
said Belle; &ldquo;that last word is very hard to say.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sorry that you think so, Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
please to say siri&aacute; zis.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle did so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Exceedingly
well,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now say yerani th&egrave; sir&egrave;ir
zis.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yerani th&egrave; sir&egrave;ir zis,&rdquo;
said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you have now
said, I love you&mdash;love me&mdash;ah! would that you would love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have said all these things?&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you have said them in Armenian.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would have said them in no language that I understood,&rdquo;
said Belle; &ldquo;and it was very wrong of you to <!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>take
advantage of my ignorance, and make me say such things.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if you said them, I said them too.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You did so,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but I believe you were
merely bantering and jeering.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As I told you before,
Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the chief difficulty which I find in teaching
you Armenian proceeds from your persisting in applying to yourself and
me every example I give.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you meant nothing
after all?&rdquo; said Belle, raising her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us
proceed,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;sirietsi, I loved.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
never loved any one but yourself,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s
more. . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirietsits, I will love,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;sirietsies, thou wilt love.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never one so
thoroughly heartless,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you what,
Belle, you are becoming intolerable, but we will change the verb; or
rather I will now proceed to tell you here, that some of the Armenian
conjugations have their anomalies; one species of these I wish to bring
before your notice.&nbsp; As old Villotte <a name="citation343"></a><a href="#footnote343">{343}</a>
says&mdash;from whose work I first contrived to pick up the rudiments
of Armenian&mdash;&lsquo;Est verborum transitivorum, quorum infinitivus
. . .&rsquo; but I forgot, you don&rsquo;t understand Latin.&nbsp; He
says there are certain transitive verbs, whose infinitive is in outsaniel;
the preterite in outsi; the imperative in oue; for example&mdash;parghat-soutsaniem,
I irritate . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, you do,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and it will be better
for both of us if you leave off doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would hardly believe, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
the <!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>Armenian
is in some respects closely connected with the Irish, but so it is;
for example, that word parghat-soutsaniem is evidently derived from
the same root as feargaim, which, in Irish, is as much as to say I vex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle, sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you account for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O man, man!&rdquo; said Belle, bursting into tears, &ldquo;for
what purpose do you ask a poor ignorant girl such a question, unless
it be to vex and irritate her?&nbsp; If you wish to display your learning,
do so to the wise and instructed, and not to me, who can scarcely read
or write.&nbsp; Oh, leave off your nonsense; yet I know you will not
do so, for it is the breath of your nostrils!&nbsp; I could have wished
we should have parted in kindness, but you will not permit it.&nbsp;
I have deserved better at your hands than such treatment.&nbsp; The
whole time we have kept company together in this place, I have scarcely
had one kind word from you, but the strangest . . .&rdquo; and here
the voice of Belle was drowned in her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to see you take on so, dear Belle,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really have given you no cause to be so unhappy; surely
teaching you a little Armenian was a very innocent kind of diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you went on so long, and in such a strange way, and
made me repeat such strange examples, as you call them, that I could
not bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, Belle, it&rsquo;s my way; and
I have dealt with you just as I would with . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hard-mouthed jade,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and you <!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>practising
your horse-witchery upon her.&nbsp; I have been of an unsubdued spirit,
I acknowledge, but I was always kind to you; and if you have made me
cry, it&rsquo;s a poor thing to boast of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boast of!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;a pretty thing indeed to boast
of; I had no idea of making you cry.&nbsp; Come, I beg your pardon;
what more can I do?&nbsp; Come, cheer up, Belle.&nbsp; You were talking
of parting; don&rsquo;t let us part, but depart, and that together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ways lie different,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they should,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
let us be off to America together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To America together?&rdquo; said Belle, looking full at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where we will settle down in some
forest, and conjugate the verb siriel conjugally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conjugally?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;as man and wife in America, air
yew ghin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are jesting, as usual,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, indeed.&nbsp; Come, Belle, make up your mind, and let
us be off to America; and leave priests, humbug, learning, and languages
behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you arc jesting,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but
I can hardly entertain your offers; however, young man, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better make up your mind at once,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
let us be off.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t make a bad husband, I assure you.&nbsp;
Perhaps you think I am not worthy of you?&nbsp; To convince you, Belle,
that I am, I am ready to try a <!-- page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>fall
with you this moment upon the grass.&nbsp; Brynhilda, the valkyrie,
swore that no one should marry her who could not fling her down.&nbsp;
Perhaps you have done the same.&nbsp; The man who eventually married
her, got a friend of his, who was called Sigurd, the serpent-killer,
to wrestle with her, disguising him in his own armour.&nbsp; Sigurd
flung her down, and won her for his friend, though he loved her himself.&nbsp;
I shall not use a similar deceit, nor employ Jasper Petulengro to personate
me&mdash;so get up, Belle, and I will do my best to fling you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I require no such thing of you, or anybody,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;you are beginning to look rather wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I every now and then do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;come, Belle,
what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say nothing at present on the subject,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;I must have time to consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;to-morrow I go to
a fair with Mr. Petulengro, perhaps you will consider whilst I am away.&nbsp;
Come, Belle, let us have some more tea.&nbsp; I wonder whether we shall
be able to procure tea as good as this in the American forest.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;THE DAWN OF DAY&mdash;THE LAST FAREWELL&mdash;DEPARTURE
FOR THE FAIR&mdash;THE FINE HORSE&mdash;RETURN TO THE DINGLE&mdash;NO
ISOPEL.</h2>
<p>It was about the dawn of day when I was awakened by the voice of
Mr. Petulengro shouting from the top of the dingle, and bidding me get
up.&nbsp; I arose instantly, <!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>and
dressed myself for the expedition to the fair.&nbsp; On leaving my tent,
I was surprised to observe Belle, entirely dressed, standing close to
her own little encampment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I
little expected to find you up so early.&nbsp; I suppose Jasper&rsquo;s
call awakened you, as it did me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I merely lay down
in my things,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and have not slept during the
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And why did you not take off your things
and go to sleep?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not undress,&rdquo;
said Belle, &ldquo;because I wished to be in readiness to bid you farewell
when you departed; and as for sleeping, I could not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
God bless you!&rdquo; said I, taking Belle by the hand.&nbsp; Belle
made no answer, and I observed that her hand was very cold.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is the matter with you?&rdquo; said I, looking her in the face.&nbsp;
Belle looked at me for a moment in the eyes, and then cast down her
own&mdash;her features were very pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are really unwell,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;I had better not go to the fair, but stay here, and take
care of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;pray
go, I am not unwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then go to your tent,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and do not endanger your health by standing abroad in
the raw morning air.&nbsp; God bless you, Belle; I shall be home to-night,
by which time I expect you will have made up your mind; if not, another
lesson in Armenian, however late the hour be.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then wrung
Belle&rsquo;s hand, and ascended to the plain above.</p>
<p>I found the Romany party waiting for me, and everything in readiness
for departing.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno were mounted on
two old horses.&nbsp; The rest who intended to go to the fair, amongst
whom <!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>were
two or three women, were on foot.&nbsp; On arriving at the extremity
of the plain, I looked towards the dingle.&nbsp; Isopel Berners stood
at the mouth, the beams of the early morning sun shone full on her noble
face and figure.&nbsp; I waved my hand towards her.&nbsp; She slowly
lifted up her right arm.&nbsp; I turned away, and never saw Isopel Berners
again. <a name="citation348"></a><a href="#footnote348">{348}</a></p>
<p>My companions and myself proceeded on our way.&nbsp; In about two
hours we reached the place where the fair was to be held.&nbsp; After
breakfasting on bread and cheese and ale behind a broken stone wall,
we drove our animals to the fair.&nbsp; The fair was a common cattle
and horse fair: there was little merriment going on, but there was no
lack of business.&nbsp; By about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
Mr. Petulengro and his people had disposed of their animals at what
they conceived very fair prices&mdash;they were all in high spirits,
and Jasper <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>proposed
to adjourn to a public-house.&nbsp; As we were proceeding to one, a
very fine horse, led by a jockey, made its appearance on the ground.&nbsp;
Mr. Petulengro stopped short, and looked at it steadfastly: &ldquo;Fino
covar dove odoy sas miro&mdash;a fine thing were that, if it were but
mine!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you covet it,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;why do you not purchase it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We low gyptians
never buy animals of that description; if we did we could never sell
them, and most likely should be had up as horse-stealers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then why did you say just now, &lsquo;It were a fine thing if
it were but yours&rsquo;?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We gyptians always
say so when we see anything that we admire.&nbsp; An animal like that
is not intended for a little hare like me, but for some grand gentleman
like yourself.&nbsp; I say, brother, do you buy that horse!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How should I buy the horse, you foolish person?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Buy the horse, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;if
you have not the money I can lend it you, though I be of lower Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You talk nonsense,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;however, I wish you
would ask the man the price of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, going
up to the jockey, inquired the price of the horse&mdash;the man, looking
at him scornfully, made no reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said
I, going up to the jockey, &ldquo;do me the favour to tell me the price
of that horse, as I suppose it is to sell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jockey,
who was a surly-looking man of about fifty, looked at me for a moment,
then, after some hesitation, said laconically, &ldquo;Seventy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, and turned away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buy that
horse,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, coming after me; &ldquo;the dook
tells me that in less <!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>than
three months he will be sold for twice seventy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will have nothing to do with him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;besides, Jasper,
I don&rsquo;t like his tail.&nbsp; Did you observe what a mean scrubby
tail he has?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a fool you are, brother!&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that very tail of his shows his breeding.&nbsp;
No good bred horse ever yet carried a fine tail&mdash;&rsquo;tis your
scrubby-tailed horses that are your out-and-outers.&nbsp; Did you ever
hear of Syntax, brother?&nbsp; That tail of his puts me in mind of Syntax.&nbsp;
Well, I say nothing more, have your own way&mdash;all I wonder at is,
that a horse like him was ever brought to such a fair of dog cattle
as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We then made the best of our way to a public-house, where we had
some refreshment.&nbsp; I then proposed returning to the encampment,
but Mr. Petulengro declined, and remained drinking with his companions
till about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when various jockeys from
the fair come in.&nbsp; After some conversation a jockey proposed a
game of cards; and in a little time, Mr. Petulengro and another gypsy
sat down to play a game of cards with two of the jockeys.</p>
<p>Though not much acquainted with cards, I soon conceived a suspicion
that the jockeys were cheating Mr. Petulengro and his companion; I therefore
called Mr. Petulengro aside, and gave him a hint to that effect.&nbsp;
Mr. Petulengro, however, instead of thanking me, told me to mind my
own bread and butter, and forthwith returned to his game.&nbsp; I continued
watching the players for some hours.&nbsp; The gypsies lost considerably,
and I saw clearly that the jockeys were cheating <!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>them
most confoundedly.&nbsp; I therefore once more called Mr. Petulengro
aside, and told him that the jockeys were cheating him, conjuring him
to return to the encampment.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, who was by this time
somewhat the worse for liquor, now fell into a passion, swore several
oaths, and asking me who had made me a Moses over him and his brethren,
told me to return to the encampment by myself.&nbsp; Incensed at the
unworthy return which my well-meant words had received, I forthwith
left the house, and having purchased a few articles of provision, I
set out for the dingle alone.&nbsp; It was dark night when I reached
it, and descending I saw the glimmer of a fire from the depths of the
dingle; my heart beat with fond anticipation of a welcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isopel
Berners is waiting for me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the first word
that I shall hear from her lips is that she has made up her mind.&nbsp;
We shall go to America, and be so happy together.&rdquo;&nbsp; On reaching
the bottom of the dingle, however, I saw seated near the fire, beside
which stood the kettle simmering, not Isopel Berners, but a gypsy girl,
who told me that Miss Berners when she went away had charged her to
keep up the fire, and have the kettle boiling against my arrival.&nbsp;
Startled at these words, I inquired at what hour Isopel had left, and
whither she was gone, and was told that she had left the dingle, with
her cart, about two hours after I departed; but where she was gone the
girl did not know.&nbsp; I then asked whether she had left no message,
and the girl replied that she had left none, but had merely given <!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>directions
about the kettle and fire, putting, at the same time, sixpence into
her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very strange,&rdquo; thought I; then dismissing
the gypsy girl I sat down by the fire.&nbsp; I had no wish for tea,
but sat looking on the embers, wondering what could be the motive of
the sudden departure of Isopel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does she mean to return?&rdquo;
thought I to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely she means to return,&rdquo;
Hope replied, &ldquo;or she would not have gone away without leaving
any message&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and yet she could scarcely mean to return,&rdquo;
muttered Foreboding, &ldquo;or she would assuredly have left some message
with the girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then thought to myself what a hard thing
it would be, if, after having made up my mind to assume the yoke of
matrimony, I should be disappointed of the woman of my choice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, after all,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I can scarcely be disappointed;
if such an ugly scoundrel as Sylvester had no difficulty in getting
such a nice wife as Ursula, surely I, who am not a tenth part so ugly,
cannot fail to obtain the hand of Isopel Berners, uncommonly fine damsel
though she be.&nbsp; Husbands do not grow upon hedge-rows; she is merely
gone after a little business and will return to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comforted in some degree by these hopeful imaginings, I retired to
my tent, and went to sleep.</p>

XXXII.&mdash;GLOOMY FOREBODINGS&mdash;THE POSTMAN&rsquo;S MOTHER&mdash;A
VALEDICTORY LETTER FROM ISOPEL WITH A LOCK OF HER HAIR&mdash;THE END
OF A CHAPTER IN THE LIFE OF THE ROMANY RYE&mdash;AND OF THE BOOK OF
ISOPEL BERNERS.</h2>
<p>Nothing occurred to me of any particular moment during the following
day.&nbsp; Isopel Berners did not return; but Mr. Petulengro and his
companions came home from the fair early in the morning.&nbsp; When
I saw him, which was about mid-day, I found him with his face bruised
and swelled.&nbsp; It appeared that, some time after I had left him,
he himself perceived that the jockeys with whom he was playing cards
were cheating him and his companion; a quarrel ensued, which terminated
in a fight between Mr. Petulengro and one of the jockeys, which lasted
some time, and in which Mr. Petulengro, though he eventually came off
victor, was considerably beaten.&nbsp; His bruises, in conjunction with
his pecuniary loss, which amounted to about seven pounds, were the cause
of his being much out of humour; before night, however, he had returned
to his usual philosophic frame of mind, and, coming up to me as I was
walking about, apologised for his behaviour on the preceding day, and
assured me that he was determined, from that time forward, never to
quarrel with a friend for giving him good advice.</p>
<p><!-- page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>Two
more days passed, and still Isopel Berners did not return.&nbsp; Gloomy
thoughts and forebodings filled my mind.&nbsp; During the day I wandered
about the neighbouring roads in the hopes of catching an early glimpse
of her and her returning vehicle; and at night lay awake, tossing about
on my hard couch, listening to the rustle of every leaf, and occasionally
thinking that I heard the sound of her wheels upon the distant road.&nbsp;
Once at midnight, just as I was about to fall into unconsciousness,
I suddenly started up, for I was convinced that I heard the sound of
wheels.&nbsp; I listened most anxiously, and the sound of wheels striking
against stones was certainly plain enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;She comes at
last,&rdquo; thought I, and for a few moments I felt as if a mountain
had been removed from my breast;&mdash;&ldquo;here she comes at last,
now, how shall I receive her?&nbsp; Oh,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I will
receive her rather coolly, just as if I was not particularly anxious
about her&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way to manage these women.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The next moment the sound became very loud, rather too loud, I thought,
to proceed from her wheels, and then by degrees became fainter.&nbsp;
Rushing out of my tent, I hurried up the path to the top of the dingle,
where I heard the sound distinctly enough, but it was going from me,
and evidently proceeded from something much larger than the cart of
Isopel.&nbsp; I could, moreover, hear the stamping of a horse&rsquo;s
hoofs at a lumbering trot.&nbsp; Those only whose hopes have been wrought
up to a high pitch, and then suddenly dashed down, can imagine what
I felt at that moment; and yet when I returned <!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>to
my lonely tent, and lay down on my hard pallet, the voice of conscience
told me that the misery I was then undergoing, I had fully merited,
from the unkind manner in which I had intended to receive her, when
for a brief moment I supposed that she had returned.</p>
<p>It was on the morning after this affair, and the fourth, if I forget
not, from the time of Isopel&rsquo;s departure, that, as I was seated
on my stone at the bottom of the dingle, getting my breakfast, I heard
an unknown voice from the path above&mdash;apparently that of a person
descending&mdash;exclaim, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a strange place to bring
a letter to;&rdquo; and presently an old woman, with a belt round her
middle, to which was attached a leathern bag, made her appearance, and
stood before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I ever!&rdquo; said she, as she looked about her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My good gentlewoman,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;pray what may you
please to want?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlewoman!&rdquo; said the old
dame, &ldquo;please to want!&mdash;well, I call that speaking civilly,
at any rate.&nbsp; It is true, civil words cost nothing; nevertheless,
we do not always get them.&nbsp; What I please to want is to deliver
a letter to a young man in this place; perhaps you be he?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name on the letter?&rdquo; said I, getting up
and going to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no name upon it,&rdquo; said
she, taking a letter out of her scrip and looking at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is directed to the young man in Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then it is for me, I make no doubt,&rdquo; said I, stretching
out my hand to take it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please to pay me ninepence <!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>first,&rdquo;
said the old woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said she, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought, &ldquo;civility is civility, and, being rather a scarce article,
should meet with some return.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the letter, young man,
and I hope you will pay for it; for if you do not, I must pay the postage
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the postwoman, I suppose?&rdquo;
said I, as I took the letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the postman&rsquo;s
mother,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;but as he has a wide beat,
I help him as much as I can, and I generally carry letters to places
like this, to which he is afraid to come himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
say the postage is ninepence,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a shilling.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I call that honourable,&rdquo; said the old woman, taking
the shilling and putting it into her pocket&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s
your change, young man,&rdquo; said she, offering me threepence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray keep that for yourself,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you deserve
it for your trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I call that genteel,&rdquo;
said the old woman; &ldquo;and as one good turn deserves another, since
you look as if you couldn&rsquo;t read, I will read your letter for
you.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see it; it&rsquo;s from some young woman or other,
I dare say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
I can read.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All the better for you,&rdquo; said
the old woman; &ldquo;your being able to read will frequently save you
a penny, for that&rsquo;s the charge I generally make for reading letters;
though, as you behaved so genteelly to me, I should have charged you
nothing.&nbsp; Well, if you can read, why don&rsquo;t you open the letter,
instead of keeping it hanging between your finger and thumb?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am in no hurry to open it,&rdquo; said I, with a sigh.&nbsp;
The old woman looked at me for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;Well, young <!-- page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>man,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;there are some&mdash;especially those who can read&mdash;who
don&rsquo;t like to open their letters when anybody is by, more especially
when they come from young women.&nbsp; Well, I won&rsquo;t intrude upon
you, but leave you alone with your letter.&nbsp; I wish it may contain
something pleasant.&nbsp; God bless you,&rdquo; and with these words
she departed.</p>
<p>I sat down on my stone, with my letter in my hand.&nbsp; I knew perfectly
well that it could have come from no other person than Isopel Berners;
but what did the letter contain?&nbsp; I guessed tolerably well what
its purport was&mdash;an eternal farewell! yet I was afraid to open
the letter, lest my expectation should be confirmed.&nbsp; There I sat
with the letter, putting off the evil moment as long as possible.&nbsp;
At length I glanced at the direction, which was written in a fine bold
hand, and was directed, as the old woman had said, to the young man
in &ldquo;Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle,&rdquo; with the addition, &ldquo;near
. . ., in the county of . . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Suddenly the idea occurred
to me, that, after all, the letter might not contain an eternal farewell;
and that Isopel might have written, requesting me to join her.&nbsp;
Could it be so?&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo; presently said Foreboding.&nbsp;
At last I became ashamed of my weakness.&nbsp; The letter must be opened
sooner or later.&nbsp; Why not at once?&nbsp; So as the bather who,
for a considerable time has stood shivering on the bank, afraid to take
the decisive plunge, suddenly takes it, I tore open the letter almost
before I was aware.&nbsp; I had no sooner done so than a paper fell
out.&nbsp; I examined it; it contained a lock of bright flaxen hair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is <!-- page 358--><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>no
good sign,&rdquo; said I, as I thrust the lock and paper into my bosom,
and proceeded to read the letter, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;TO THE YOUNG MAN IN MUMPERS&rsquo; DINGLE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I send these lines,
with the hope and trust that they will find you well, even as I am myself
at this moment, and in much better spirits, for my own are not such
as I could wish they were, being sometimes rather hysterical and vapourish,
and at other times, and most often, very low.&nbsp; I am at a sea-port,
and am just going on shipboard; and when you get these I shall be on
the salt waters, on my way to a distant country, and leaving my own
behind me, which I do not expect ever to see again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, young man, I will, in the first place, say something
about the manner in which I quitted you.&nbsp; It must have seemed somewhat
singular to you that I went away without taking any leave, or giving
you the slightest hint that I was going; but I did not do so without
considerable reflection.&nbsp; I was afraid that I should not be able
to support a leave-taking; and as you had said that you were determined
to go wherever I did, I thought it best not to tell you at all; for
I did not think it advisable that you should go with me, and I wished
to have no dispute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second place, I wish to say something about an offer
of wedlock which you made me; perhaps, young man, had you made it at
the first period of our acquaintance, I should have accepted it, but
you did <!-- page 359--><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>not,
and kept putting off and putting off, and behaving in a very grange
manner, till I could stand your conduct no longer, but determined upon
leaving you and Old England, which last step I had been long thinking
about; so when you made your offer at last, everything was arranged&mdash;my
cart and donkey engaged to be sold&mdash;and the greater part of my
things disposed of.&nbsp; However, young man, when you did make it,
I frankly tell you that I had half a mind to accept it; at last, however,
after very much consideration, I thought it best to leave you for ever,
because, for some time past, I had become almost convinced, that though
with a wonderful deal of learning, and exceedingly shrewd in some things,
you were&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t be offended&mdash;at the root mad! and
though mad people, I have been told sometimes make very good husbands,
I was unwilling that your friends, if you had any, should say that Belle
Berners, the workhouse girl, took advantage of your infirmity; for there
is no concealing that I was born and bred up in a workhouse; notwithstanding
that, my blood is better than your own, and as good as the best; you
having yourself told me that my name is a noble name, and once, if I
mistake not, that it was the same word as baron, which is the same thing
as bear; and that to be called in old times a bear was considered a
great compliment&mdash;the bear being a mighty strong animal, on which
account our forefathers called all their great fighting-men barons,
which is the same as bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, setting matters of blood and family entirely aside,
many thanks to you, young man, from <!-- page 360--><a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>poor
Belle, for the honour you did her in making that same offer; for, after
all, it is an honour to receive an honourable offer, which she could
see clearly yours was, with no floriness nor chaff in it; but, on the
contrary, entire sincerity.&nbsp; She assures you that she shall always
bear it and yourself in mind, whether on land or water; and as a proof
of the good-will she bears to you, she sends you a lock of the hair
which she wears on her head, which you were often looking at, and were
pleased to call flax, which word she supposes you meant as a compliment,
even as the old people meant to pass a compliment to their great folks,
when they called them bears; though she cannot help thinking that they
might have found an animal as strong as a bear, and somewhat less uncouth,
to call their great folks after: even as she thinks yourself, amongst
your great store of words, might have found something a little more
genteel to call her hair after than flax, which, though strong and useful,
is rather a coarse and common kind of article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as another proof of the good-will she bears to you, she
sends you, along with the lock, a piece of advice, which is worth all
the hair in the world, to say nothing of the flax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fear God</i>, and take your own part.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Bible in that, young man; see how Moses feared God, and how he took
his own part against everybody who meddled with him.&nbsp; And see how
David feared God, and took his own part against all the bloody enemies
which surrounded him&mdash;so fear God, young man, and <!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>never
give in.&nbsp; The world can bully, and is fond, provided it sees a
man in a kind of difficulty, of getting about him, calling him coarse
names, and even going so far as to hustle him; but the world, like all
bullies, carries a white feather in its tail, and no sooner sees the
man taking off his coat, and offering to fight his best, than it scatters
here and there, and is always civil to him afterwards.&nbsp; So when
folks are disposed to ill-treat you, young man, say &lsquo;Lord, have
mercy upon me!&rsquo; and then tip them Long Melford, to which, as the
saying goes, there is nothing comparable for shortness all the world
over; and these last words, young man, are the last you will ever have
from her who is nevertheless,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your affectionate female servant,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Isopel Berners</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading the letter I sat for some time motionless, holding
it in my hand. <a name="citation361"></a><a href="#footnote361">{361}</a>&nbsp;
The day-dream in which I had been a little time before indulging, of
marrying Isopel Berners, of going with her to America, and having by
her a large progeny, who were to assist me in felling trees, cultivating
the soil, and who would take care of me when I was old, was now thoroughly
dispelled.&nbsp; Isopel had deserted me, and was gone to America by
<!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>herself,
where, perhaps, she would marry some other person, and would bear him
a progeny, who would do for him what in my dream I had hoped my progeny
by her would do for me.&nbsp; Then the thought came into my head that
though she was gone I might follow her to America, but then I thought
that if I did I might not find her; America was a very large place,
and I did not know the port to which she was bound; but I could follow
her to the port from which she had sailed, and there possibly discover
the port to which she was bound; but then I did not even know the port
from which she had set out, for Isopel had not dated her letter from
any place.&nbsp; Suddenly it occurred to me that the post-mark on the
letter would tell me from whence it came, so I forthwith looked at the
back of the letter, and in the post-mark read the name of a well-known
and not very distant sea-port.&nbsp; I then knew with tolerable certainty
the port where she had embarked, and I almost determined to follow her,
but I almost instantly determined to do no such thing.&nbsp; Isopel
Berners had abandoned me, and I would not follow her; &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo;
whispered Pride, &ldquo;if I overtook her, she would only despise me
for running after her&rdquo;; and it also told me pretty roundly that,
provided I ran after her, whether I overtook her or not, I should heartily
despise myself.&nbsp; So I determined not to follow Isopel Berners;
I took her lock of hair, and looked at it, then put it in her letter,
which I folded up and carefully stowed away, resolved to keep both for
ever, but I determined not to follow her.&nbsp; Two or three <!-- page 363--><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>times,
however, during the day I wavered in my determination, and was again
and again almost tempted to follow her, but every succeeding time the
temptation was fainter.&nbsp; In the evening I left the dingle, and
sat down with Mr. Petulengro and his family by the door of his tent.&nbsp;
Mr. Petulengro soon began talking of the letter which I had received
in the morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not from Miss Berners, brother?&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; I told him it was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is she coming back, brother?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;she is gone to America, and has
deserted me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I always knew that you two were never
destined for each other,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you know
that?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dook told me so, brother;
you are born to be a great traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;if I had gone with her to America, as I was thinking
of doing, I should have been a great traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are to travel in another direction, brother,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish you would tell me all about my future wanderings,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
a power of clouds before my eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a poor
seer, after all,&rdquo; said I, and getting up, I retired to my dingle
and my tent, where I betook myself to my bed, and there, knowing the
worst, and being no longer agitated by apprehension, nor agonised by
expectation, I was soon buried in a deep slumber, the first which I
had fallen into for several nights.</p>

the marvellous facility with which some people learn languages in the
latter sense we have a good example cited by Alfred Russel Wallace,
in the case of a Flemish planter of Ceram, near Amboyna, named Captain
Van der Beck.&nbsp; &ldquo;When quite a youth he had accompanied a Government
official who was sent to report on the trade and commerce of the Mediterranean,
and had acquired <i>the colloquial language of every place they stayed
a few weeks at</i>.&nbsp; He had afterwards made voyages to St. Petersburg,
and to other parts of Europe, including a few weeks in London; and had
then come out to the East, where he had been for some years trading
and speculating in the various islands.&nbsp; He now spoke Dutch, French,
Malay and Javanese, all equally well; English with a very slight accent,
but with perfect fluency, and a most complete knowledge of idiom, in
which I often tried to puzzle him in vain.&nbsp; German and Italian
were also quite familiar to him, and his acquaintance with European
languages included Modern Greek, Turkish, Russian and colloquial Hebrew
and Latin.&nbsp; As a test of his power, I may mention that he had made
a voyage to the out-of-the-way island of Salibaboo, and had stayed there
trading a few weeks.&nbsp; As I was collecting vocabularies, he told
me he thought he could remember some words, and dictated a considerable
number.&nbsp; Some time after I met with a short list of words taken
down in those islands, and in every case they agreed with those he had
given me.&nbsp; He used to sing a Hebrew drinking-song, which he had
learned from some Jews with whom he had once travelled and astonished
by joining in their conversation.&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23">{23}</a>&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s colloquial gift was, to all appearance, closely allied
to that of this polyglot Fleming.</p>

<i>The Malay Archipelago</i>, 1890, p. 269.</p>
<p><a name="footnote25"></a><a href="#citation25">{25}</a>&nbsp; Flunkeyism
he called it, and thence deduced the pecuniary miseries of Scott&rsquo;s
later life.&nbsp; His depreciatory view was in part, too, I believe,
an echo from his favourite <i>Vidocq</i>.&nbsp; Speaking of the gipsies
in his chapter on &ldquo;Les Careurs,&rdquo; Vidocq calls them a species
characterised and depicted with so little truth by the first romance-writer
of our time.&nbsp; But Borrow certainly had a far deeper reason for
his dislike of Scott.&nbsp; Under the specious pretence of deference
for antiquity and respect for primitive models, he imagined that Scott
was sapping the foundations of Protestantism.&nbsp; Newman from the
opposite camp saw only the beneficial effect of Scott&rsquo;s influence
in turning men&rsquo;s minds in the direction of the Middle Ages.&nbsp;
(See his article in the <i>British Critic</i> for April 1839, and <i>Apologia</i>,
chap. iii.).&nbsp; As for Wordsworth, Borrow (with characteristic wrong-headedness)
conceived him as an impostor.&nbsp; Had <i>he</i> made Nature his tent
and the hard earth his bed with the stars for a canopy?&nbsp; No; he
walked out to sing of moorland, and fell from a &ldquo;highly eligible&rdquo;
cottage in the Lakes, where women-folk, at his beck and call, bore the
brunt of the &ldquo;plain living.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote27a"></a><a href="#citation27a">{27a}</a>&nbsp;
The &ldquo;splendid old corsair,&rdquo; E. J. T., is best known perhaps
as the grim and grizzled pilot in Millais&rsquo; great picture (now
in the Tate) of the North-west Passage.&nbsp; Trelawny and Borrow are
linked together as men whose mental powers were strong but whose bodily
powers were still stronger in the <i>Memoirs</i> of Gordon Hake (who
knew both of them well).&nbsp; Another rival of Borrow in respect to
the <i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i> was the famous Dr. Whewell, Master
of Trinity.&nbsp; Mr. Murray tells a story of his concern at a dinner-party
upon a prospect of an altercation between Borrow and Whewell.&nbsp;
With both omniscience was a foible.&nbsp; Both were powerful men; and
both of them, if report were true, had more than a superficial knowledge
of the art of self-defence.</p>
<p><a name="footnote27b"></a><a href="#citation27b">{27b}</a>&nbsp;
As a matter of fact there was nothing in the least degree squalid about
Borrow&rsquo;s subjects or treatment.&nbsp; His tramps and vagabonds
have nothing about them that is repulsive.&nbsp; Borrow, it is true,
was ready enough to condone the offences of those who sought dupes among
the well-to-do public; but he preferred the honester members of the
vagrant class; and it is plain that they reciprocated the preference,
for they regarded the Romany Rye with an almost superstitious reverence
on account of his truth, honour bright and fair speech.&nbsp; Borrow
had a passion for depicting the class that Hurtado de Mendoza had first
caught for literature in his <i>Lazarillo</i> (1553)&mdash;that, namely,
of the old tricksters of the highway who still retained many traits,
noble and ignoble, from the primeval savage.&nbsp; For the characteristically
mean and squalid one must go up higher in the scale of civilisation.</p>

all the reviews of <i>Lavengro</i>, extraordinary as many now appear,
it was left for the month of July in the year of grace 1900 to produce
the most delightfully amazing.&nbsp; We subjoin it verbatim from the
<i>Catholic Times</i> of July 27th, 1900.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lavengro: The Scholar, The Gypsy, The
Priest</span>.&nbsp; By George Burrow.&nbsp; With an introduction by
Theodore Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; (London: Ward, Lock, and Co., Ltd.)&nbsp;
2s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suppose the publishers find that this sort of literary
rubbish, suffused with antediluvian bigotry of the most benighted character,
pays: otherwise, no doubt, they would not have issued it as a volume
of their &lsquo;New Minerva Library.&rsquo;&nbsp; It consists of a twaddling
introduction by Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton, who tells us he has been
&lsquo;brought into personal relations with many men of genius,&rsquo;
and so on <i>ad nauseam</i>, and of a sort of novel by Mr. Burrow, in
a palpable imitation of the style of De Foe without a spark of De Foe&rsquo;s
ability.&nbsp; The only thing for which this Mr. Burrow is distinguished
is his crass anti-Catholic bigotry; and the terms in which, in one part
of the book at least, he refers to the Blessed Virgin are an outrage
not merely on the religious feelings of Catholics, but also on ordinary
propriety.&nbsp; Catholics, unless they deserve to be treated scornfully,
will take note of the fact that such a work as this has been issued
by Messrs. Ward and Lock.&rdquo;&nbsp; To get an idea of the <i>semper
eadem</i> of Catholic criticism, the reader should compare with the
above the <i>Dublin Review</i> for May 1843, in which the author of
the <i>Bible in Spain</i> is described as &ldquo;a missionary sent out
by a gang of conspirators against Christianity who denominate themselves
the Bible Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote37"></a><a href="#citation37">{37}</a>&nbsp; The
popularity of <i>Lavengro</i> has been rapidly on the increase during
the past ten years, if we may judge by the number of editions.&nbsp;
It was printed in the Minerva series in 1889, and reprinted 1900.&nbsp;
A version of large portions of the work by Duclos appeared in 1892.&nbsp;
Macmillans published an edition in 1896, Newnes in 1897.&nbsp; It was
included in the &ldquo;Oxford Library,&rdquo; 1898.&nbsp; An illustrated
edition, an edition produced under the supervision of Dr. Knapp, a miniature
edition of Dent&rsquo;s, and the reprint of the Minerva edition, already
referred to, appeared in 1900, apart from booksellers&rsquo; reprints
such as those of Denny and Mudie.</p>

Borrow is said to have expressed a desire to meet but three sentient
beings: Dan O&rsquo;Connell, Lamplighter (a racehorse), and Anna Gurney.&nbsp;
He was introduced into the presence of the last-mentioned at Sheringham,
but so far below the vision was the reality (as must appear) that he
turned and ran without stopping till he came to the Old Tucker&rsquo;s
Inn at Cromer (East Anglian tradition).</p>
<p><a name="footnote39b"></a><a href="#citation39b">{39b}</a>&nbsp;
Mary Clarke, widow, daughter of Edmund Skepper, was wedded to Borrow
on April 23rd, 1840.&nbsp; Her daughter, Henrietta, is still living
at a great age at Yarmouth.&nbsp; Borrow gives a characteristic account
of these two ladies in the first chapter of <i>Wild Wales</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of my wife I will merely say that she is a perfect paragon of
wives&mdash;can make puddings and sweets and treacle posset, and is
the best woman of business in East Anglia: of my step-daughter, for
such she is though I generally call her daughter, and with good reason
seeing that she has always shown herself a daughter to me, that she
has all kinds of good qualities and several accomplishments, knowing
something of conchology, more of botany, drawing capitally in the Dutch
style, and playing remarkably well on the guitar&mdash;not the trumpery
German thing so-called, but the real Spanish guitar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
mother had died in August 1858.</p>
<p><a name="footnote40"></a><a href="#citation40">{40}</a>&nbsp; This
was written in December 1900.</p>
<p><a name="footnote43"></a><a href="#citation43">{43}</a>&nbsp; There
remains only the <i>Appendix</i>.&nbsp; A delightful resum&eacute; of
grievances brooded over in solitude, cruelly stigmatised by Professor
Knapp as &ldquo;certain posterior interpolations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ground
base of the theme is the wickedness of popery; and when argument gives
out Borrow is ready with all the boyish inconsequence of a Charles Kingsley
to throw up his cap and shout &lsquo;Go it, our side!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Down
with the Pope!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote49"></a><a href="#citation49">{49}</a>&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
personal appearance, as we know from the later portrait by his most
intimate friend, Dr. Thomas Gordon Hake, must have been sufficiently
striking at any period of his life.&nbsp; &ldquo;His figure was tall
and his bearing very noble.&nbsp; He had a finely moulded head and thick
white hair&mdash;white from his youth; his brown eyes were soft, yet
piercing; his mouth had a generous curve&mdash;his nose was somewhat
of the Semitic type, which gave his face the cast of a young Memnon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is confirmed by the assurance in <i>Lavengro</i> that a famous
heroic painter was extremely anxious to secure Don Jorge as a model
for the face and figure of Pharaoh!</p>

The main characters in <i>Lavengro</i> are three: the scholar (Borrow
himself), the gypsy (Mr. Petulengro), and the priest, or popish propagandist.&nbsp;
This last is the man in black.&nbsp; The word-master has in the course
of his travels heard a good deal about this man, and he is able to identify
him almost at once by his predilection for gin and water, cold, with
a lump of sugar in it.&nbsp; He hears of him first from his London friend,
Francis Ardry, then from an Armenian merchant whom he met in London,
and then again from a brother-author, who describes a silly and intrusive
Anglican parson, called Platitude, as a puppet in the hands of &ldquo;the
man in black.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter he characterises as a sharking
priest, who has come over from Italy to proselytize and plunder; he
has &ldquo;some powers of conversation and some learning, but he carries
the countenance of an arch-villain; Platitude is evidently his tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote107"></a><a href="#citation107">{107}</a>&nbsp;
When Borrow (Lavengro, that is), was in London, his friend Francis Ardry
warned him against a certain papistical propagandist: &ldquo;A strange
fellow&mdash;a half Italian, half English priest . . . he is fond of
a glass of gin and water&mdash;and over a glass of gin and water cold,
with a lump of sugar in it, he has been more communicative, perhaps,
than was altogether prudent.&nbsp; Were I my own master, I would kick
him, politics and religious movements, to a considerable distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote110"></a><a href="#citation110">{110}</a>&nbsp;
During his travels after his abandonment of Grub Street, &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
frequently came upon the traces of the man in black.&nbsp; While sojourning
for one night with a hospitable though superstitious acquaintance, whom
he met after leaving Salisbury, &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; heard the story
of the Rev. Mr. Platitude, a sacerdotalist of weak intellects who had
been cajoled from his lawful allegiance to the &ldquo;good, quiet Church
of England,&rdquo; by the wiles of a sharking priest come over from
Italy to proselytize and to plunder.&nbsp; From what he then heard of
the sharking priest, by putting two and two together, Lavengro was now
able to identify him with the &ldquo;man in black.&rdquo;&nbsp; Subsequently
he heard of the efforts of the same clever dialectician to overcome
the Methodist preacher Peter Williams&mdash;efforts which collapsed
upon the appearance of the preacher&rsquo;s wife Winifred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wife,
wife,&rdquo; muttered the disconcerted priest, &ldquo;if the fool has
a wife he will never do for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of his wanderings
this nineteenth-century S. Augustine often gave himself out to be a
teacher of elocution.</p>
<p><a name="footnote117"></a><a href="#citation117">{117}</a>&nbsp;
The man in black was completely mystified by the knowledge of his own
past life which this remark revealed (see Chap. IX. <i>infra.</i>).&nbsp;
There were, as have been seen, a variety of threads connecting the man
in black with definite scenes in the memory of Lavengro, though the
latter did not happen to have seen the &ldquo;prowling priest&rdquo;
in the flesh before this occasion.&nbsp; While in London Lavengro frequently
met a certain Armenian merchant, who much resented the pretensions of
the Roman Papa: that he, the Papa, had more to say in heaven than the
Armenian patriarch, and that the hillocks of Rome were higher than the
ridges of Ararat.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Papa of Rome,&rdquo; said the Armenian
to Lavengro, &ldquo;has at present many emissaries in this country,
in order to seduce the people from their own quiet religion to the savage
heresy of Rome; this fellow&rdquo; (describing the man in black) &ldquo;came
to me partly in the hope of converting me, but principally to extort
money for the purpose of furthering the designs of Rome in this country.&nbsp;
I humoured the fellow at first, keeping him in play for nearly a month,
deceiving and laughing at him.&nbsp; At last he discovered that he could
make nothing of me, and departed with the scowl of Caiaphas, whilst
I cried after him, &lsquo;The roots of Ararat are <i>deeper</i> than
those of Rome.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This same Armenian subsequently offered Lavengro a desk in his office
opposite his deaf Moldavian clerk, having surmised that he would make
an excellent merchant because he squinted like a true Armenian.&nbsp;
Unhappily for the Flaming Tinman and for Isopel Berners, the word-master
refused this singular offer.</p>

For Borrow&rsquo;s final verdict on Sir Walter Scott, it is only fair
to cite his <i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i>, a book on the English Gypsy Language,
corresponding to his book on the <i>Zincali</i> or Spanish Gypsies,
but published more than forty years later, namely in 1874.&nbsp; Here
he relates how he once trudged to Dryburgh &ldquo;to pay my respects
at the tomb of Sir Walter Scott, a man with whose principles I have
no sympathy, but for whose genius I have always entertained the most

The Petulengres, a wandering clan of gypsies, led by Jasper Petulengro
and his wife Pakomovna are introduced to us in <i>Lavengro</i> (chaps,
v. and liv.).&nbsp; The etymology is thus explained by Borrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Petulengro: A compound of the modern Greek &pi;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;
and the Sanscrit <i>kara</i>; the literal meaning being lord of the
horse-shoe (<i>i.e.</i> maker), it is one of the private cognominations
of &lsquo;the Smiths,&rsquo; an English gypsy clan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Engro
is apparently akin to the English suffix monger, and with it may be
compared the Anglo-Saxon suffix smith, in such words as lore-smith or
war-smith (warrior).&nbsp; Thus we have sapengro, lavengro, and sherengro,
head man.&nbsp; Of the gypsy tribes in England, Borrow in his <i>Zincali</i>
(ed. 1846, Introd.) has the following: &ldquo;The principal gypsy tribes
at present in existence are the Stanleys, whose grand haunt is the New
Forest; the Lovells, who are fond of London and its vicinity: the Coopers,
who call Windsor Castle their home; the Hernes, to whom the north country,
more especially Yorkshire, belongeth; and lastly my brethren the Smiths,
to whom East Anglia appears to have been allotted from the beginning.&nbsp;
All these families have gypsy names, which seem, however, to be little
more than attempts at translation of the English ones.&nbsp; Thus the
Stanleys are called Bar-engres, which means stony fellows, the Coopers,
Wardo-engres or wheelwrights, the Lovells, Camo-mescres, or amorous
fellows, the Hernes (German Haaren), Balors, hairs, or hairy fellows,
while the Smiths are called Petulengres, that is, horseshoe-fellows,
or blacksmiths.&nbsp; Besides the above-named gypsy clans, there are
other smaller ones, some of which do not comprise more than a dozen
individuals, children included.&nbsp; For example, the Bosviles, the
Browns, the Chilcotts, the Grays, Lees, Taylors and Whites; of these
the principal is the Bosvile tribe.&rdquo;</p>

Ursula is evidently intended by Borrow to typify the gypsy chi.&nbsp;
And the key to the type is supplied in the <i>Gypsies in Spain</i> (see
especially chap. vii.).&nbsp; The gypsies, says Borrow, arc almost entirely
ignorant of the grand points of morality; but on one point they are
in general wiser than those who have had far better opportunities than
such unfortunate outcasts of regulating their steps and distinguishing
good from evil.&nbsp; They know that chastity is a jewel of high price,
and that conjugal fidelity is capable of occasionally flinging a sunshine
even over the dreary hours of a life passed in the contempt of almost
all laws, whether human or divine.&nbsp; There is a word in the gypsy
language to which those who speak it attach ideas of peculiar reverence,
far superior to that connected with the name of the Supreme Being, the
creator of themselves and the universe.&nbsp; This word is <i>L&aacute;cha</i>,
which with them is the corporeal chastity of the females; we say corporeal
chastity, for no other do they hold in the slightest esteem; it is lawful
among them, nay praiseworthy, to be obscene in look, gesture and discourse,
to be accessories to vice, and to stand by and laugh at the worst abominations
of the Busn&eacute; (gorgios, or gentiles) provided their <i>L&aacute;cha
ye trupos</i>, or corporeal chastity, remains unblemished.&nbsp; The
gypsy child, from her earliest years, is told by her strange mother
that a good Calli need only dread one thing in this world, and that
is the loss of her <i>L&aacute;cha</i>, in comparison with which that
of life is of little consequence, as in such an event she will be provided
for, but what provision is there for a gypsy who has lost her <i>L&aacute;cha</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bear this in mind, my child,&rdquo; she will say, &ldquo;and
now eat this bread and go forth and see what you can steal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Romany, in a word, is the sect of the Husbands (and Wives) and their
first precept is this: Be faithful to the <i>Roms</i> (husbands) and
take not up with the gorgios, whether they be raior (gentlemen) or baior
(fellows).</p>

The next time the compassionate word-master visited the landlord, he
found him a &lsquo;down pin&rsquo; no longer, but the centre of an adulatory
crowd.&nbsp; The way in which he surmounted the sea of troubles that
beset him is described with much humour in <i>The Romany Rye</i> (chap.
xvii).&nbsp; The main factors in his relief were (1) Strong ale, taken
by the advice of Lavengro, which leads to Catchpole knocking down the
radical, Hunter, and winning back the admiration of the tap-room, (2)
a loan from the parson of Willenhall, who wished to save a muscular
fellow-Protestant from the clutches of the man in black.&nbsp; The brewer
now became very civil, a coach was appointed to stop at the inn, and,
in short, Catchpole is left by Lavengro riding upon the summit of the
wave of popularity and good fortune.</p>

And this, alas! is the last glimpse we are to have of Isopel Berners,
a heroine whose like we shall scarce encounter again in the whole wide
world of romance.&nbsp; Charles Kingsley says of her, indeed, that she
is far too good not to be true.&nbsp; The likeness is undoubtedly a
masterpiece, yet, though Borrow has drawn the outline firmly, he leaves
much for the imagination to fill in.&nbsp; Languid indeed must be the
imagination that can fail to be stimulated by Borrow&rsquo;s outline
of his Brynhilda.&nbsp; Cast in the mould of Britannia, queen, however,
not of the waves but of the woodland, poor yet noble, and innocent of
every mean ambition of gentility, faithful, valiant, and proud,&mdash;as
she stands pale and commanding, in the sunshine at the dingle&rsquo;s
mouth, in all her virginal dignity, is she not a figure worthy to rank
with the queens of Beauty and Romance, with Dido &ldquo;with a willow
in her hand,&rdquo; with the deeply-loving Rebecca as with a calm and
tender dignity she bids for ever adieu to the land of Wilfred of Ivanhoe?</p>
<p><a name="footnote361"></a><a href="#citation361">{361}</a>&nbsp;
After the receipt of this letter three nights elapsed, and then the
word-master himself left the dingle for the last time.&nbsp; The third
night he spent alone in his encampment &ldquo;in a very melancholy manner,
with little or no sleep, thinking of Isopel Berners; and in the morning
when I quitted the place, I shed several tears, as I reflected that
I should probably never again see the spot where I had passed so many
hours in her company.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
